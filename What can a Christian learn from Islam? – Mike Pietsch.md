The following list of questions have been formulated during my recent trip through SE Asia during which time I read several books about Islam, visited Mosques and spoke with a number of people.

I have also had a much longer term interest in Islam through my visits to the Middle East and because both Christianity and Islam are part of the same family of religions called ‘the people of the book’.

The response to my questions will be given by the **Muslim chaplain to Flinders University, Abul Farooque**. The questions have been put together so that Abul can help me to better understand what Islam is about. Please excuse their clumsiness and somewhat Christian bias. These questions to Abul will form a springboard to focus on my understandings and misunderstandings of Islam. Being a Christian I will also be trying to understand what is similar and what is different between the two faiths.

There seems to be many basic similarities between Islam and Christianity, such as monotheism and a strong sense of the importance of the Judeo-Christian prophetic tradition (as I understand it in the Christian Bible of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament). Equally, there is a sense of addressing justice and the evil in the world and living in this world that Allah created.

- If reason and logic are important in Islam, what are the things in Islam that do not depend on reason but on faith and trust, and possibly seem to be ‘unreasonable’ or even ‘illogical’? Are there any aspects in Islam similar to the seemingly illogical aspects of Christianity, such as Allah dying, loving your enemy who is against you, or Allah being beyond and over reason?
- Some people see Islam as essentially a theocratic legal-political system? How accurate is this and/ or what are the other dimensions of Islam?
- How does Islam deal with evil?
- Where does evil come from? What role does Satan have, if any? How does Islam deal with injustice? Is there a ‘hell’ and for whom is it reserved? Is there a judgement day? On what basis will Allah be judging people?
- Is there any concept or means of salvation from our human condition in Islam?
- Does Islam see human beings as made in the image of Allah (as referred to in Gen 1), and if so, what ‘human’ aspects has Allah imprinted on humanity?
- To what extent does Allah limit himself? E.g. is Allah limited by the boundaries of scientific laws? Or, according to the free-will which Allah has given to human beings, has Allah limited himself to be able to force someone to believe in him? Does Allah allow limited himself to be limited by a person’s wilfulness or lack of faith?
- Which is the more important quality of Allah, love or power? It seems that Allah’s power is more important for Islam, whereas for Christianity the emphasis is on Allah’s love. In Christianity, Allah has given up his powers to become a human in the person of Jesus in order to woo stubborn humans back into a loving and subservient relationship with Allah.
- It seems that in Islam Allah is more distant and impersonal and therefore difficult to approach. In Islam, Allah is often described as One, Unique, All-powerful, All-knowing, the Creator, the Most-Gracious, the most Merciful, etc. Is Allah often described as All-loving?
- In Islam, Allah seems to be like a benign dictator or ruler who is somewhat distant or to be feared rather than loved. Is Allah seen as primarily a law-giver and judge?
- Apart from Shi’ite and Sunni, what other schools/ denominations are there in Islam? Why does Islam persecute the followers of the Bah’ai faith so severely?

These are a few questions to initiate my discussion with Abul and to deepen my understanding and appreciation of Islam. I look forward to our interchange.
