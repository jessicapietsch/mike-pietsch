## Understanding the three-year Lectionary cycle

The Bible readings for each Sunday which are read in Christian worship services have been devised in all sorts of ways over the centuries. The Church has created these so that a broad reading of Scripture is heard by the community and then used as a basis for preachers. This lessens the possibility of preachers focusing on their one-eyed ‘hobby-horses’ or ‘pet-readings’.

Currently the most popular list of readings is known as ‘ **The three-year Lectionary** ’ because it cycles widely through three years, covering a large amount of the Biblical text.

The three-year lectionary was devised first by the Roman Catholic Church after its radical re-shaping which happened during the Vatican II Council during the mid-1960s. This occurred in the Roman Catholic Church when there was a renewed interest in allowing the Bible to be more openly read in the church. It was designed to cover all the major parts of the Bible over a three-year cycle.

This original model has been integrated and worked on since then by many of the Protestant mainline churches such as Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian and Uniting. Other churches variously have also adopted its use in part or whole.

## A different focus each year

The three-year lectionary has as its basis a focus on one of the synoptic Gospels each year:

- Year A focuses on the Gospel of Matthew
- Year B on the Gospel of Mark
- Year C on the Gospel of Luke

The Gospel of John is scattered through the three years, especially through the season of Easter, but other times as well.

## The format of the weekly service

Each week follows a similar format:

- A passage is read from the Old Testament (the Hebrew Scriptures) and one from the New Testament letters to the churches (the Epistles)
- Together with these, a **Psalm** is read (or sung)
- These three other readings (apart from the Gospel) usually have some connection with the Gospel reading of the day

This format ensures that many parts of the Bible are read, which gives an overall perspective.

## Overview of the three year cycle

It should also be noted that each of the three years basically follow the same shape:

- The first half of the year is based on the life of Jesus of Nazareth.
- It begins with his birth (the Christmas season of 12 days) which is prepared for in the Advent season, the four Sundays before Christmas.
- Then it and goes on to the season of ‘epiphanies’ (Epiphany) which explores Jesus’ teaching and miracles.
- This climaxes in his Transfiguration on the top of a mountain.
- It then plunges down into the season of Lent (beginning with Ash Wednesday) during which time Jesus’ temptation, suffering and death are the focus.
- This takes us up until Holy week, which begins with Palm Sunday (Jesus’ entrance into Jerusalem). It concludes with Maundy Thursday and Good Friday (Jesus’ death).
- Then comes the season of Easter for seven weeks, concluding with Jesus’ Ascension back to heaven and the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost Sunday.

Then we are up to the second half of the year, which is called Pentecost.

During this time, the followers of Jesus grow in their faith as they are nurtured by the Holy Spirit to understand life more fully with a wide range of Biblical texts exploring more of what Jesus and the Christian faith are all about.

These begin with the question of ‘Who is God?’ on Trinity Sunday and conclude on the last Sundays of the church year with an exploration of the judgement and the Cosmic Christ.
