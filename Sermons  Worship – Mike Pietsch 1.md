- rsday and Good Friday (Jesus’ death).
- Then comes the season of Easter for seven weeks, concluding with Jesus’ Ascension back to heaven and the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost Sunday.

Then we are up to the second half of the year, which is called Pentecost.

During this time, the followers of Jesus grow in their faith as they are nurtured by the Holy Spirit to understand life more fully with a wide range of Biblical texts exploring more of what Jesus and the Christian faith are all about.

These begin with the question of ‘Who is God?’ on Trinity Sunday and conclude on the last Sundays of the church year with an exploration of the judgement and the Cosmic Christ.
