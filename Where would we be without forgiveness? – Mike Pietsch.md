Last night on ABC Radio on Radio National there was a program on ‘Forgiveness’ in the regular show called ‘Big Ideas’. When I tuned into the program, the speaker was quoting Biblical texts and parables of Jesus and explaining the various ways in which the Bible and Jesus try and describe ‘ **Forgiveness** ’.

I was taken aback just hearing such a full-on Biblical expose on Forgiveness on a Radio station that in the past would shy away from anything ‘religious’, apart from its designated ‘religious’ programs. In recent years I have noticed that the younger generation of ABC presenters are not so anti-religious and are more open-minded to discuss all sorts of topics including spirituality. This is also evident by the addition of two new programs on Radio National that specifically deal with religion. One is called ‘Spirituality’ and the other is ‘God Forbid’. They have excellent speakers and guests on them and very interesting topics.

Before I share with you some of the ideas from the program, can we ask ourselves some questions?

How could we live each day without forgiveness? If I did not forgive my husband or wife for something that they had done wrong, how could we look at each other openly and honestly, let alone with love? If I did not know that God forgives every wrong that I do, how could I dare to pray to God or, let alone attend a worship service in a church? If I had hurt one of my children and they were personally badly affected by this, how could I live knowing that I had hurt them? Even if they might have forgiven me, if I did not allow myself to be forgiven, or forgive myself, how could I face each day? I would feel less than whole and continue to focus on a negative view of myself. Where does self-forgiveness fit into all of this?

The ABC program was a lecture presented by an **Anglican priest Stephen Cherry in England**. He has been studying the topic for decades and showed how many university researchers have recently been studying forgiveness.

He showed how in the **New Testament** there are various ways of describing Jesus’ understanding of forgiveness. Sometimes this is done in an exaggerated way to make a point, such as forgiving ‘ *not just seven times, but 70 times seven times (490) in a day* ’.

Forgiveness is not just a one size fits all formula. It depends on the circumstances and attitudes of both the person hurt and the one who needs to hear that they are forgiven. Cherry pointed out the various ways in which one can look at forgiveness, asking questions about at what point you offer forgiveness when you have been wronged. Do you wait for a sign of repentance, regret, or an apology, or until they offer to make up for their wrong in some way? Or do you wait for a promise not to do it again? How do you forgive someone if you do not know who wronged you?

Cherry gave the interesting example of the priest **Michael Lapsley in South Africa** who had his hands blown off by a mail bomb in the last days of the apartheid regime. The culprit has never been discovered. But Lapsley has imagined what he might do if the person turned up at his door one day asking him for forgiveness. Some of the questions that he might ask would include whether he has stopped making damaging weapons. He would also ask if the bomb maker is now living in a more positive manner. Lapsley would also explain to the bomb maker that what happened to him has totally changed his life and his ability to look after himself without any hands. Would he help him in any way? The question of relating forgiveness and justice comes into all of this. To what extent can forgiveness wrongly wipe out the need for justice?

The **three major types of forgiveness** have similarities but they also have differences. There is the forgiveness that we offer **to another person when we have been hurt by them**. There is also the situation when we have perhaps **both been in the wrong**. Who forgives first? What if one of the people does not accept our apology and our request to be forgiven? How do we achieve both justice and mercy? How can I also forgive myself?

May I conclude with one of the most beautiful moments of forgiveness recorded in the Bible. It is **between two twin brothers**, Jacob and Esau. Jacob stole the inheritance from Esau, and Esau promised to murder Jacob. Jacob fled to their home country for more than 20 years and upon their return Jacob reaches out to Esau. Read for yourself the whole account in Genesis 32:3-33:11.

The highlight is when Jacob says after embracing and kissing Esau: ‘ *to see your face is like seeing the face of God* ’ (33:10). Full forgiveness includes all three people involved: God, me and the other person. But it is never easy.
