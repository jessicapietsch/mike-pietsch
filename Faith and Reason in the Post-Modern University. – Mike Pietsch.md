### Introduction

I stand before you as a fellow chaplain with hopefully something for you to think about. This issue has been with me all my life, but brought into sharper focus during my recent 17 years as a university chaplain.

But I also hope that this session will be mutually helpful for me as well. I look forward to your challenges as well as new ideas and cross-fertilisation between us that will occur throughout our sessions this morning, as well as throughout the conference.

I am sure that quite a few of you will not agree with some of the ideas that I will be putting forward and I look forward to hearing your point of view. This can be quite a sticky area of life on a university campus because it can go very wrong or occur in a very naïve sort of way. There are also many ways in which this issue can be approached and nuanced.

I will be handing out to you electronically everything that I am presenting today. But I hope you will be jotting down all sorts of interesting thoughts and ideas that might flash through your mind over these two sessions together.

The **faith basis** on which I am presenting these sessions is essentially Christian, but I hope you can translate it into whatever faith you might have as the basis for your view of life and the world. However, I think we will find that there will be much in common between faiths as we address the fundamental and broad issues of faith and reason. Your particular faith insights will be much appreciated along the way.

**My personal background** in this area begins from the time I could think and challenge my religious teachers which primarily included Sunday School teachers as well as my father who was a pastor. I remember well the many discussions and questions that my sister and I fired at all and sundry over Sunday lunches or evening meals together. Also, the discussions in youth group meetings, Christian university group meetings and conferences, along with the many casual conversations with a wide variety of Christians and atheists have been most formative and challenging.

The **first session** today will address the theoretical aspects of this issue. In the **second session** I will present how I am attempting to address this issue in my ministry on campus in South Australian universities.

### The theory of the Nexus of faith and reason

There are a number of reasons why I believe people of faith, in particular university chaplains, should take the opportunities to engage in discussion and debate at all levels of our universities.

The *Office of Campus Ministry in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles* has devised a much-used analysis of the **many dimensions of university chaplaincy**, suggesting that there are seven main ways in which a chaplain can operate within a university.

They are as follows:

1. Presence (availability on campus in many ways)
2. Counselling (proactive and reactive)
3. Social Action/Advocacy (consciousness-raising of issues and needs)
4. Sacramental (liturgical, pre-baptismal, pre-marriage catechesis)
5. Educational/Academic (formal and informal teaching and discussion)
6. Community (encouraging friendship and making links between people)
7. Pastoral (visitation, spiritual direction, facilitating retreats)

Each individual chaplain may carry out their role through these seven ways, with varying degrees of emphasis and energy (some possibly to only a more limited degree). The role of the chaplain addressing faith and reason is found under the fifth characteristic of a chaplain or chaplaincy team. It is this area that I will be addressing today. It is only one of the seven areas, but I believe that in the academic arena people of faith should be able to address intellectual questions, discussion and debate with in an appropriate way.

There are many reasons why a person of faith (such as the chaplain) should consider engaging at the intellectual level of reasoning with their faith in the context of the university.

**1.** — The first is that universities have often been founded due to the connection between theology and knowledge or wisdom. This is true of most of the major faith groups including Confucianism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism and Christianity.

The following dates (culled from Wikipedia) give us an idea of the founding of these centres of learning which grew out of their respective faith traditions:

**Confucian ——** Nanjing learning institution (now university) 259 AD  
**Buddhist ——** Taxila Pakistan 5C BC; Nalanda NE India 427-1197 AD  
**Islam ——** Madrasah Fas, Morocco 859; al-Azhar university, Egypt 959  
**Hindi ——** Taxila Pakistan 5C BC  
**Christian ——** Cathedral / monastic schools 6C AD, then Bologna (1088), Paris (1150), Oxford (1167), Cambridge (1209)

**2.** — Some argue that even though universities may have been founded by religious communities, since the Enlightenment the most progressive and more recently established universities have minimised or thrown out their theology departments and even religious departments. They have declared the university to be a purely rational and religious free environment in which any expressions of faith are meaningless or even damaging. My response to this narrow and naïve approach is to note the following realities:

1. In order to teach comprehensively and understand the history of humans you need to describe and understand their religious beliefs both in the past and in recent history.
2. The intersection and relationship between philosophy and religion is historically and intellectually intertwined and the two areas inevitably cross over into each other. This is obviously true of the issues such as ‘The existence of God’ and ‘Theodicy’ and the ‘Origins of evil’, but it is also true of the ethical and lifestyle questions discussed by philosophy.
3. In order to understand contemporary and past politics, theology and religion feature significantly, and this can be seen to be increasing at the moment rather than decreasing. Consider the current newspaper articles which often have articles addressing the relationship between Christians and Muslims, Eastern and Western thought/ beliefs and politics and the persecution of various religious minorities, often by a complicit political regime.
4. Many of the Arts subjects are based on theological and religious texts, images and writings. This ranges from books and paintings on specifically religious themes to allusions and metaphors that are used in passing or underlie the text or image.
5. Anthropology, sociology and psychology all have to take account of matters of faith when attempting to understand the cultures and human beings whom they have under their academic ‘microscopes’.
6. But these connections are not only confined to the Arts and Social Sciences. The recent area of Cosmology within the Physics departments has in the last decade been engaging more and more with the dimension of including ‘the mind of God’ (a Creator or God) in the actual equation of how the world began and also in an attempt to understand how the complexity of the world came about and is maintained. This is most recently seen more publicly in the writings of the militant atheists and the response from scientists of varying degrees of faith.
7. The whole concept of a ‘university’ has behind it the idea that there is a common or universal truth towards which all academics are striving. If there is no concept of ‘truth’ or ‘genuineness’ or ‘credibility’, then why do we have academic discussions about a more accurate way of viewing certain historic events or the features of a molecular, or any such matter that is taught to undergraduate students.
8. Many cosmological physicists are attempting to find the ‘Grand Universal Theory’ in order to understand how the theories of light, matter, energy and matter are related to each other. There is the prior presumption that there is an underlying formula that holds them and the whole universe together.
9. The university often prides itself as a place for free, open and logical discussion and debate. This goes back to one of the basic tenets when the universities were being established in the Western world. It is part of the university being seen as a place of independence and refuge for those who might have controversial issues as part of their discussion, which might go against the political or economic *status quo*. This has also included now or controversial religious ideas such as occurred during the time of the Protestant Reformation.

### Various types of universities and their relationship to matters of faith and spirituality.

It must be noted that the following four ‘types’ of university in Australia are not water-tight groups and have a degree of overlap between them. But they are grouped just to address their specific features.

**1\. — Fully secular universities** founded as non-sectarian in the late 1800s due to the churches not being able to agree together. This includes what are called the ‘Sandstone’ universities in Australia, which are the main basis for the ‘Group of Eight’ (the most academic universities).

Even within these universities, though they might not have any formal avenues for academic theological/ religious study, they run courses in such things as ‘Religion and Politics in SE Asia’ ‘Science and Religion’ and ‘The Islam Financial system’. Some also have specific Research Groups such as the one that Rev Dr Paul Babie has established in connection with the Law School at Adelaide uni called “Society, Law and Religion”.

**2\. — Universities which have theological faculties attached** to them which provide theological education. They are technically not a part of the university but the degree granting is done through the university and sometimes students at the university can do some of the theological subjects as extra non-core subjects as part of their degrees. This includes Flinders university, the University of Melbourne and possibly others.

**3\. — Secular universities which have established a religious studies / theological faculty**. This has often occurred in more recent years, after the establishment of the university (eg the University of South Australia).

**4\. — Faith-based universities** for whom religion and theology are presumed in all areas of teaching. This would include universities such as the Australian Catholic University and Notre Dame. As part of this group could be included the many Colleges of theology which operate independently of and actual university, but which have degree granting rights.

### The Currently Opening Door

I now wish to share two newspaper articles written by the Vice Chancellor of Macquarie University, Professor Stephen Schwartz and one by Andrew Trounson introducing Cardinal Newman to the university scene in Australia. These articles complete text can be found on the website of The Australian newspaper.

#### 1\. Stephen Schwartz: ‘More than a burger joint’ (May 07, 2008)

Some salient quotes from this article follow:

> ‘Universities are big places…One map was the victim of graffiti. Right under the orientation arrow and the words “You are here”, someone had written, “But why?”

> … Hamburger University \[in Chicago, US\]. It’s the management training facility for the McDonald’s restaurant chain … No one is likely to confuse it with a real university. But why not? How does it differ from a real university …?’

> Schwartz then goes through a number of distinguishing factors of a ‘real’ university, but dismissing each one as perhaps not totally different from Hamburger University. These include: varied disciplines; research; curiosity driven research; non-vocational; etc.

> He then notes that the British inquiry into universities (Dearing) identified not just three purposes for universities (teaching, research and community engagement) but a fourth which is to “play a major role in shaping democratic, civilised, inclusive society”. ‘A strong civil society cannot be taken for granted. It depends on a solid foundation of education. As Epictetus said< “only the educated are free”.’

> ‘Real universities are the engines of economic growth without which civil societies would wither and social justice would be impossible. Hamburger U adds value to McDonald’s employees. Why are we here? We are here to increase the freedom of everyone.’

#### 2\. Andrew Trounso (Oct 06, 2010)

The article was written at the time when three VCs attended a symposium to celebrate Cardinal John Henry Newman’s beatification by the Pope. The three VCs made it clear that Newman’s ideas were driving change.

> ‘Melbourne vice-chancellor Glyn Davis said Newman’s views were a timely challenge to what he saw as Australia’s narrow definition of a university…’

> Monash University’s Ed Byrne invoked Newman’s emphasis on education when he said that talented educators had been held back by he sector’s reliance on research output as the measure of performance.

> Australian Catholic University vice-chancellor Greg Craven drew on Newman’s idea of a university based on a particular view, be it the Catholic faith or secular liberalism or something else, as a source for diversity. “All universities live within their own truths and value systems and the only question is which,” he said.

> The Catholic notion of unity of faith and reason was becoming more popular without us realising it. Professor Craven noted Macquarie University vice-chancellor Stephen Schwartz’s plans to teach undergraduates “practical wisdom” and Melbourne’s model of broad undergraduate education. “Perhaps even the Melbourne model represents a whispering of Newman’s soul in the heart of Glyn Davis,” he said.’

#### 3\. Stephen Schwartz on Cardinal Newman (Oct 13, 2010)

The next article, a spoof written a week later, relates how Newman might attempt to change our current universities by means of a series of emails to various parts of the ‘Woolloomooloo university’. The complete text can be found on the website.

As a background to the spoof it should be at least known that Newman recommended that theology should be an integral part of university education. Additionally, knowledge for the sake of knowledge and learning should be a central part of a university. It need have no utilitarian purpose other than to educate the whole person.

And finally, before we look at Newman’s ‘Idea of a University’, a quote from the second of the current *Boyer Lectures* which are being given by the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, **Professor Glyn Davis**:

> ‘Some argue for a further mission for universities, that of developing moral judgment in students. The timing is good — for young students in particular, university coincides with growing into adulthood. For some this proves a time of uncertainty and introspection, for others an opportunity for eager experiment. Campus is a place to work out who, and what, we want to be.

> Universities are often reluctant to defend a moral role — who is to say which set of values should prevail? Public universities are secular and non-partisan, welcoming all creeds and none.

> Yet written into the fabric of the institution are core beliefs about the importance of truth, knowledge and social justice. This means scholarly inquiry must be open and critical …

> There are values implicit in university mottos, in statements of graduate attributes, printed on the banners to fly on open days. In recent times the Australian Catholic University and Macquarie University, among others, have decided to make these values more visible, as they explore the moral dimension of higher education.

> The Australian Catholic University has created a Flagship for Creative and Authentic Leadership, designed to encourage moral and ethical leadership. ACU is writing core curriculum to reflect its Catholic mission and identity.

> Stephen Schwartz, vice-chancellor at Macquarie, champions teaching to build character through investigation of moral values. He argues that universities should do more than train people for the workforce and make their countries richer. People need jobs and students understandably worry about their career, but Professor Schwartz suggests that to be successful — in profession, in life-students need also to learn how to think, how to make decisions in difficult circumstances, how to be wise before and during the event. They need, in short, what Aristotle called ‘practical wisdom’. Macquarie has reshaped teaching so all students, whatever their major, are challenged to think about, and apply, moral and ethical decision-making.’

### John Henry Newman’s ‘Idea of a University’

The following extracts are the responses of two contemporary academics to Newman’s thoughts on the important parts of a university. They can be found in the latter part of a volume titled ‘ *The Idea of a University* ’ by John Henry Newman. The book is edited by Frank M. Turner and includes responses by five academics. It is in a series by Yale University called “Rethinking the Western Tradition” Yale University Press, 1996.

#### The response of Frank M. Turner

**“Newman’s university and ours”**

> ‘Newman’s language has established the style and the essential mode of discourse with which to speak and write of the academic life. Virtually everything else written about universities has lacked his harmony and style and the capacities of his ideas to resonate with the desire that the educational process, whatever else it may do, rise above the humdrum of everyday existence and transform the immature into the mature, the unformed into the formed, the unreflective into the reflective, the youth into the adult.’ (p 283)

> ‘Indeed, there appears little about Newman’s life and outlook or the character of his institution to qualify the book that arose from those experiences as on of the educational and literary masterpieces of the Western world. Yet there *The Idea of a University* stands, a challenge to its own time and a rebuke to much of the character of the late-twentieth-century university.’ (pp 285, 286)

> ‘The two primary themes …are, first, Newman’s contention that a university must include theology as part of its curriculum, and, second, his assertion that a university should teach universal knowledge as an end in itself. The former has been left quietly undiscussed by commentators; the latter has received usually uncritical admiration …’ (p 286)

> ‘In Newman’s mind, theology is a realm of knowledge, and religious truth undergirds and informs all other truth. One can dismiss this religious conviction as a nineteenth-century phenomenon that need no longer be of any concern now that most universities…are largely secularised. But to do so would be to ignore important groups in and around the contemporary academy who still accept much of Newman’s argument, even if they do not share all his premises or conclusion.’ (pp 286, 287)

> ‘Within the past decade the debate over the impact of “secular humanism” on American education resounded through the popular media. That same impulse against secular learning is now touching the universities in Islamic nations.’ (p 287)

> ‘From the other end of the political spectrum ideological positions articulated in the name of so-called political correctness or in the cause of making universities “morally better” places than the surrounding culture—positions that no less than religious fundamentalism may involve limitations on freedom of thought and speech in the academy—clearly represent a secularised version of the religious truth that Newman saw conditioning all other thought and teaching in the life of a university. Both the religious and secular critics seek to find or impose a wider framework of truth or understanding within which the university and its activities should function.’ (p 287)

> ‘Newman believed in the appropriateness and even the necessity of faith-commitments being related to undergraduate teaching and the university’s moral ethos. In contrast, however, to modern religious and secular fundamentalists, Newman himself established considerable space for intellectual freedom. He constructed it in a rather awkward way, but he established it nonetheless. Understanding Newman’s position allows us to see how he could combine religion with secular learning to the consternation of religious fundamentalists and how he could separate secular learning from moral transformation to the consternation of those who would have universities be the agents of cultural and political transformation.’ (p 287)

> ‘His separation of human history and human life into secular-natural and sacred-supernatural spheres meant that Newman, unlike many persons in the late twentieth-century university, laboured under no illusion that a liberal education can lead to either moral virtue or religious faith. Paradoxically Newman’s faith that human sinfulness requires supernatural redemption limited the moral aspirations of his university. In his view the liberal education addressed only the natural human being in a natural civic setting. The liberal education could not address the issues relating to human redemption.
> 
> As he remarked,
> 
> Knowledge is one thing, virtue is another; good sense is not conscience, refinement is not humility, nor is largeness and justness of view faith. Philosophy, however enlightened, however profound, gives no command over the passions, no influential motives, no vivifying principles. Liberal education makes not the Christian, not the Catholic, but the gentleman. It is well to be a gentleman, it is well to have a cultivated intellect, a delicate taste, a candid, equitable, dispassionate mind, a noble and courteous bearing in the conduct of life; — these are the connatural qualities of a large knowledge; they are the objects of the University; I am advocating, I shall illustrate and insist upon them; but still, I repeat, they are no guarantee for sanctity of even for conscientiousness, they may attach to the man of the world, to the profligate, to the heartless … then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and pride of man. (89-90)

For Newman, the liberal education led to “intellectual excellence” (90), but that excellence was not to be confused with moral transformation. It was the Roman Catholic *Church*  not the Roman Catholic  *University* that opened the path to divine truth and human redemption.

> Newman was no educational utopian. Only a generation of scholars, having imbibed various secular utopian traditions and having learned to live without the internal or external underpinnings of religious faith, has come to expect universities to do what the church and the great religions in the past have been expected to do.
> 
> ‘Newman was not caught in the intellectual bind of present-day censor-prone scholars who, lacking any transcendental faith, must seek from the finite, secular world the spiritual regeneration that Newman found only in the realm of the sacred. At the same time he also displayed rather more confidence in religious faith and truth than those who would establish institutions to protect students from secular humanism.
> 
> Newman’s articulation of the university’s mission, as providing knowledge that is an end in itself within the ethos of Catholicism, proved transportable and mutable well beyond Dublin. His vision transformed the university into an institution that, whether or not distinctly religious, possessed a character that transcended everyday life, the realm of useful, instrumental knowledge…The emphasis on teaching universal knowledge as an end in itself became for many scholars a kind of secular religion that raised the goal of their own vocation above others in the bourgeois societies in which universities especially have flourished.
> 
> By making the function of the university transcend any narrow utility, Newman associated the university with the ideal of organic wholeness, as opposed to mechanistic division, that has proved so powerful in modern thought from Rousseau and Burke to Marx and Wagner. This outlook linked Newman’s work to an intellectual tradition broader than that of Roman Catholicism and allowed to his work to speak to audiences who might spurn religious faith but who no less fervently spurned the values of middle-class society associated with useful knowledge.
> 
> ‘Newman urged that university knowledge is “not merely a means to something beyond it, or the preliminary of certain arts into which it naturally resolves, but an end sufficient to rest in and to pursue for its own sake” ….Newman thus set himself and the institution whose idea he articulated against the ideals of utility and useful knowledge and consequently made the distinguishing value of the university its apparent *uselessness*. The usefulness, indeed the higher calling, of the university was its very lack of direct social and economic utility. The transcendent uselessness, even more than the various protections of law, contract and custom, has preserved much of the freedom of university life. It has allowed universities to be havens where students may pursue studies and activities not directly or practically applicable to later life while they mature toward adulthood. It has provided faculties with the possibility of pursuing teaching and research that need not necessarily be directly useful. It has provided the possibility of contained eccentric creativity. The word  *University* has remained the same from Newman’s day to ours while the reality it describes has not.’ (p 291)
> 
> ‘Professional schools, like Aristotle in Raphael’s painting *The School of Athens*, remind the modern university that the great questions cannot remain “academic” and that the academy must reach the larger world. In that painting of Plato and Aristotle conversing, Plato holds the  *Timaeus*, which speculates on natural philosophy and a mystical cosmology, and Aristotle holds his  *Ethics*, which explores the role of morality in the good society. Plato’s hand points to the heavens and perhaps also to the realm of his beloved ideal forms. By contrast, Aristotle strides forth pointing directly to the earth.’

#### The response of George M Marsden

**“Theology and the University: Newman’s Idea and Current Realities”**

> ‘For Newman…theology is pivotal to the idea of a university. After Discourse I, theology is his first topic. “A University”, he argues, “by its very name professes to teach universal knowledge: Theology is surely a branch of knowledge: how then is it possible for it to profess all branches of knowledge, and yet to exclude from the subjects of its teaching one which, to say the least, is as important and large as any of them?” (25) Newman is not merely including theology among the sciences studied at the university; he intends something more basic. Theology’s presence provides a necessary context for the proper conduct of the other disciplines. Essential to Newman’s outlook is that all knowledge is connected. Truths about any part of the universe are qualified by their relation to truths about other parts of the universe. This interrelatedness of all truth is essential to his ideal of an educated person. “True enlargement of mind,” he writes, “is the power of viewing many things at once as a whole, of referring them severally to their true place in the universal system, of understanding their respective values, and determining their mutual dependence.” (99) If a university fosters such integrated learning, each of the arts and the sciences needs to reckon with the insights of all others. Since relationships to God are the most important of human relationships, no university can fulfill its task of pursuing universal knowledge if knowledge about God is not part of the context for all other knowledge.’ (p 303)

> ‘Newman correctly identified one of the major afflictions of academic thought since his time. Each discipline tends to aggrandize its way of looking at reality and to ignore other ways. Economists, for example, see economics as basic for understanding human experience. Psychologists see psychological factors as basic…Communications among disciplines becomes almost impossible…Thus, although we have accumulated incredibly more information and expertise in the past century and a half, we have far less sense than our ancestors did of how one part of our experiences relate to the rest.’ (pp 303, 304)

> ‘Even apart from the question of theology’s place, this fragmentation of knowledge undermines the possibility of a coherent ideal for a university. “The idea of a multiversity” seems a contradiction in terms. Universities today have no central point of reference, no overarching philosophy. Rather, they are clearinghouses for numerous special interests in the production of information and opinion. Students become educated in parcels of specialized knowledge, but they are poorly equipped to evaluate interrelationships of these parcels or to weigh their relative importance.
> 
> Newman, seeing the beginnings of modern academic specialization and the tendency of each discipline to regard itself as primary, argued that for a university to survive as a coherent entity, philosophy would have to play a central rope as the “science of sciences”. Philosophers, who should look at human knowledge as a whole, could balance the claims of the various disciplines, including, of course, theology. In today’s multiversity, philosophy is a marginal, specialized discipline. Theology is altogether absent from the mainstream intellectual enterprise.’ (p 304)

> ‘If other sciences hope to understand the most significant truths about human experience, they must take the truths of theology into account. Otherwise, they are engaged in a futile attempt to understand essential questions about the universe without considering it as a whole. They are attempting to understand the creation without any knowledge of the creator.’ (p 305)

> ‘Even though relating one’s faith to the rest of one’s thought has a distinguished intellectual heritage, most academics today regard it as unprofessional and entirely out of place. Reporting on the suggestion that faith and scholarship might mix, the *Chronicle of Higher Education* summarized one prominent historian’s response: “The notion that scholar’s personal beliefs are compatible with their academic interests is ‘loony’ and reflects a ‘self-indulgent professesoriate.’”According to this view, religious beliefs are purely “personal,” and hence it would be “self-indulgent” to introduce them into one’s professional thought. Given such prejudices, most religious academics, especially younger ones, learn to keep quiet about their faith. In the United States the anomaly this creates is particularly striking. Most of the population professes rather traditional Christian beliefs about fundamental dimensions of reality, and many such believers study in universities. Yet within the universities themselves, there is almost no effort to relate these dimensions of human experience.’ (p 305)

> ‘There is nothing comparable to feminist studies, which explore the implications of gender for other fields of study. Or contrast the role of Marxists, who seem threatened with extinction in the rest of the nation’s population, but have prominent representatives in many academic fields.’ (p 306)

> ‘The suggestion that today’s universities be open to efforts to integrate religious traditions with learning needs to be qualified by a number of ground rules. Many people in every religion use faith as a substitute for learning, professing to rely for all their answers on religious authority. They are accordingly dogmatic and see the academic arena as another place to proselytize—attitudes that are not appropriate to the diverse modern academy.’ (p 306)

> For many good reasons (and also reactions to excessive abuses and religious dominance) the general law has been developed (both written and unwritten) which says: ‘any religious expression is widely thought to be unscientific, unprofessional, and inappropriate.’ (p 307)

> ‘The question remains, however, whether this strong rule, though its origins are understandable, is a good one. Is it not perhaps an overcorrection for what were real problems? Is there not a way to reopen a university’s intellectual life to specific religious concerns while continuing to guard against excesses? Is there not, in other words, a middle way?’ (pp 307, 308)

> ‘In answering these questions, we should recognize that religion has never been entirely absent from contemporary intellectual life, despite what some proponents of a strict separation might imagine. All scholarship takes place in the context of social location, assumptions, prior commitments, and religious beliefs of scholars. Religious commitments and assumptions are therefore inevitably present for scholars who are seriously religious. These commitments may be kept in the background and be undeveloped, but they are present nonetheless. Especially in fields that have to do with human behaviour, such prior assumptions and commitments, whatever the source, can have a major impact on scholarship.’ (p 308)

\[Marsden then gives several examples of feminists, Marxists, neo-conservatives and old-style liberals, etc.\]

> ‘This observation does not, however, license partisan scholarship that ignores standards of evidence and argument. As some representatives of each of the positions mentioned above have demonstrated, one can be bound by strong social or ideological commitments and still adhere to the highest scholarly standards. In the more technical parts of one’s scholarship, or in fields that are largely technical or scientific, one’s prior commitments are likely to have little appreciable impact, although may still determine what is important. As scholarship moves into interpretation, especially in matters that involve human relationships, epistemology, and metaphysics, prior commitments come more into play. The best scholars, however, will still defend their viewpoints with evidence and arguments that are accessible to people of other outlooks.’ (p 308)

> ‘The belief, for instance, that persons should be treated equally, regardless of race or gender, is not susceptible to scientific demonstration. It rests, rather, on the authority of communities that have accepted a tradition of valuing equality and also on the intuitions of people who have been shaped by those communities. Yet this belief serves as the moral premise for much of modern thought and as the point of departure for much scholarly interpretation. It is not true, then, that religious beliefs can be clearly separated from other beliefs on the basis that religious beliefs rest on appeals to authority and tradition, while acceptable academic beliefs must rest on scientific evidence alone. All scholars bring to their work many background assumptions that do not ultimately rest on solid evidence. Although these beliefs do not themselves serve as evidence in mainstream scholarship, they shape its parameters. Religious beliefs can influence scholarship in just the same way.’ (p 309)

### Conclusion

But how does this fit into the Post-Modern university where if we take post-modernism to its logical point, we have only relativity and only what is true for each individual at a particular time and situation. There is no ‘ultimate truth’ or ‘common truth’ or ‘theoretical truth’ or Grand United Theory’ which holds the whole world, humanity, nature and universe together, let alone a *uni* -versity. We are only left with many  *multi* -versities either in the one ‘educational institution’ or scattered across the globe. Is there such a thing as striving for what proves ‘true’ or ‘genuine’ or ‘real’?

I think that Post-Modernism has had a major role to play in breaking the stranglehold that Modernism has had with its primary legacy from the Enlightenment where ‘Reason’ was supposedly supreme. But unfortunately Reason became the new ‘god’ as it rightly questioned the arrogance of the formalised and institutionalised “Christian West”. Post-modernism has come to push all the idols off their ‘thrones’ and to point out the Emperor is wearing no clothes. But if Post-Modernism takes its place either on the throne (or off it), we are all left naked and isolated and without anything or anyone to connect with, except our solipsistic babble, all of which is true for ourselves or else is just rubbish. I believe that the current generation of young people, and gradually the wider community has seen through this gaping hole in Post-Modernism and is calling for a more balanced and open approach.

I believe that more of us are coming to the discussion table with a greater degree of humility and openness to ask both the big and everyday questions of life, from “Is there a God?” to “Do we need to be teaching courtesy and manners to the next generation?”

Post-Modernism has broken everyone’s attempt to have a strangle-hold of power over life and to be aware of our human limitations. This includes the limitations of the university as well. The university does not have to be the fount of all wisdom and the new ‘God’ on the throne of our humanistic society. But it certainly is a major partner in the whole enterprise of asking the question: “What does it mean to be human?” and the further question: “In what ways can we facilitate our humanity and our roles as humans in the universe?” Post-Modernism has opened the door for all areas of enquiry and study to make a contribution to this process, including theology and astrology. It is only by open discussion that the truth and benefits of these old and new members at the table will be discovered. It is not by banning them from the discussion or by saying certain discussions are not ‘politically correct’. All should be given a hearing and should be analysed, researched and then become part of the education process.

As chaplains, I believe that we have a responsibility to nurture a more open appreciation for the relationship between faith and reason, spirituality and logic. Even if it is not our primary focus as a chaplain we can encourage others and where possible create opportunities for students and staff to consider this link between the two. The door at the moment is slightly ajar. How might you open it a bit further and encourage the intellectual dialogue between the spiritual and the intellectual?
