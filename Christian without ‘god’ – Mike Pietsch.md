## Can I be a Christian without the ‘god’ bit?

This is a great question for discussion. It is something that has been lived and explored, especially for the last two hundred years (at least) since the Age of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. It is often formally described as a ‘humanist’ worldview as it only takes into account what can be comprehended or understood from a purely human and logical/ reasoned perspective. But it can take many forms, just as Christianity takes many shapes depending on the angle of each individual or community.

My initial response to this possibility of the Christian faith without a ‘god’ factor is that I feel that it is very cramping, narrow and limited. For me, to leave out the larger dimensions of spirituality and a world outside of what we can see or understand is like trying to cram the complexities and richness of life into something the size of a doll’s house. It leaves out the questions of where we have come from and where we are going to, including the biggest question ‘Why are we here?’ It discourages asking what happened before the ‘Big Bang’ created our universe as we know it, and what did it take to have that phenomenal event in place, before the Big Bang even happened? It ignores the question of what happens when we die. Are we just ‘eaten by worms’ and become part of the compost of life in the environment (whether we are buried or burned)? Is my conversation or love expressed to another human being anything at all apart from electrodes flashing in a variety of directions?

Another question that occurs to me is that often the person who wants to live a Christian life without the ‘god’ bit, wants to have all the supposedly ‘good bits’ of Christianity like love, peace, kindness, generosity, and good will. This is great that these are seen to be good qualities of Jesus and the Kingdom of God, but my question is where do these values come from if there is no belief in a ‘god’ or the value of human life? Do these qualities come from logic and reason? Do they come from the evolutionary process which is normally advanced on the basis of the ‘survival of the fittest’? Where do the ideas of justice and compassion for the vulnerable come from, and fairness for the underdog? Should not they just be part of those who do not have the right to survive because they drag back the strong ones?

A world without the ‘god bit’ also often sees human beings as essentially ‘good’ and says that they get evil or damaged by their environment and the people around them. They believe that every person is essentially good, and that we just have to provide the right environment for them and they will act lovingly. This is only a partial truth because we all know the stories about ‘The Lord of the Flies’ where the boys on the island end up killing each other. Likewise in the book ‘Animal Farm’ where they all start off with of the best of intentions trying to live a shared communal life, but in the end some are found to be ‘more equal than others’. I find more realistic and honest the concept that we are all created in the image of God with beautiful and wonderful dimensions. But we all also have brokenness and cracks in our make-up which some people call ‘the human condition’. I describe it as naturally self-centred. While things are going ok, we may not try to get our own way because we can get what we need. But as soon as we are starting to lose what we want we dig in our heels to look after ‘me first’.

Another dimension that is lost when we narrow our view of the world to reason and logic is that the whole complexity of relationships is bleached out. The passionate complexities of love and hate, jealousy and possessiveness, anger and evil, sacrifice and kindness, redemption and forgiveness, and a host more gut-wrenching human agonies and inspirational ideals are explained away or denied or not allowed to have good honest venting. Nor are they able to be addressed and used to bring about healing and life through healthy engagement and process. They express the whole gamut of human experiences from the evil and Satanic to the heavenly and sublime. The Greeks attempted to integrate and explore them in the various Greek gods and goddesses, as does the Hindu religion with its many hundreds of gods. Christianity has most, if not all, of these passionate complexities within the passion, suffering and death of Jesus with all of the emotions in there from the disciples to the Jewish and Roman leaders to Jesus himself.

Sometimes I find that this humanist world view, which does not want ‘god’ to be part of the picture, is more of a reaction to having a negative experience of a religious world view, and so it rejects not just the bad parts of that religious world but the whole of it. I agree with many people and views about the distorted and negative aspects of the ways in which some (if not many) people just use religion for their own ends (including and especially some disreputable leaders in the church). But I think we need to be careful to not ‘throw out the baby with the bath water’. We need to throw out the filthy water and name and own it, especially if we are directly involved in that personally. So, keeping a balanced perspective then we are to celebrate and thank the baby, who is the baby who came in all love, humility and compassion through the lowly couple of Mary and Joseph.

> If the ‘god’ who might be out there is loving, compassionate, gracious and life-giving, I find that the honesty about who I am and the love expressed towards me and others in so many ways, not only helps me to understand myself and the immediate world around me, but also helps me to see how it all hangs together. This C S Lewis’s saying is one of my favourites: “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” I find that the message and life of Jesus Christ as understood in the context of the Jewish faith puts together the complex pieces of the “jigsaw of life” in a very satisfying, honest and comforting manner. Another of Lewis’s quotes also says much: “Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.” And if I may include a final quote by one of the authors of the most respected Secretary-Generals of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold, “God does not die on the day when we cease to believe in a personal deity, but we die on the day when our lives cease to be illuminated by the steady radiance, renewed daily, of a wonder, the source of which is beyond all reason.”

If we choose to live in a world without the ‘god-factor’ we become the only authority in this world that has no deity or overriding ‘person in charge’. In fact, we become ‘god’ ourself. There is no one else to blame or point the finger at when things get messed up. We bear the burden and responsibility for all the good and all the evil of what human beings do and create. Thus there is no one nor any mechanism outside of ourselves that can deal with the consequences of our actions. We ourselves have to live with whatever happens. There is consequences and guilt, and little room for forgiveness. It does mean that we can take all the credit when things are going well, but when they go pear-shaped and even evil events occur (such as wars, ‘accidents’, broken lives and families, etc) we also then need to admit that these occurred due to our active participation or our lack of involvement and letting bad things happen. We are all responsible, to varying degrees. On the other hand, if there is a God/ Creator/ Authority we have someone who can address our dilemma and there is good and evil forces in our universe we acknowledge that we are not the only causes of evil, we can see that we are complicit in a larger web of evil led by beings that are wanting to tempt us and lead us into a negative life-style that hurts other people (including ourselves). As we admit our complicit involvement in various types of evil and brokenness, we can also hear the hopeful words of a ‘god’ who stands by us, forgiving us and offers to fill us with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

There is a saying that one occasionally reads on the back of cars and around the place that says: “Practice random acts of kindness”. It is good to encourage these acts of kindness at times when perhaps people least expect them. It is a lovely surprise to be given a word of commendation or encouragement, or to receive an unexpected gift or help with a task that might seem insurmountable. For me it is concerning that these acts of kindness are random rather than regular or all the time. What happens in between the random acts? Is that when we are unkind or uncaring and do nothing? It is said that we hear seven times more negative comments about our selves than positive, and that it takes seven positive comments to help us to cope with the one negative one. Left to our own devices as human beings we tend to be on the ‘look after me first’ side of things and if we have anything left over we will consider the needs of others. As a species, I personally find that I need more that what Mike Pietsch can put in. That is why for me receiving the love of God from outside of myself gives me added love and compassion for other people. Knowing that I am loved by someone and something far bigger than me enables me to not worry about myself as much and look to the needs of others around me. If it is only Mike Pietsch and the rest of humanity that exists, I too easily resort to the principle of the ‘survival of the fittest’.

> **‘Those who wish even to focus on the problem of a Christian ethic are faced with an outrageous demand—from the outset they must give up, as inappropriate to this topic, the very two questions that led them to deal with the ethical problem: “How can I be good?” and “How can I do something good?” Instead, they must ask the wholly other, completely different question: what is the will of God? This demand is radical precisely it presupposes a decision about ultimate reality, that is, a decision of faith. When the ethical problem presents itself essentially as the question of my own being good and doing good, the decision has already been made that the self and the world are the ultimate realities. All ethical reflection then has the goal that I be good, and that the world—by my action—becomes good. If it turns out, however, that these realities, myself and the world, are themselves embedded in a wholly other ultimate reality, namely, the reality of God the Creator, Reconciler and Redeemer, then the ethical problem takes on a whole new aspect. Of ultimate importance, then, is not that I become good, or that the condition of the world be improved by my efforts, but that the reality of God show itself everywhere to be the ultimate reality.’**

> **‘Where God is known by faith to be the ultimate reality, the source of my ethical concern will be that God be known as the good., even at the risk that I and the world are revealed as not good, but as bad through and through. All things appear as in a distorted mirror if they are not seen and recognized in God. All that is—so to speak—given, all laws and norms, are abstractions, as long as God is not known in faith to be the ultimate reality. That God alone is the ultimate reality, is, however, not an idea meant to sublimate the actual world, nor is it the religious perfecting of a profane worldview. It is rather a faithful Yes to God’s self-witness, God’s revelation…But then the decision about the whole of life depends on our relationship to God’s revelation. Awareness of it is not only a step-by-step progress in the discovery of deeper and more inward realities, but this awareness is the turning point, the pivot, of all perception of reality as such. The ultimate, or final, reality discloses itself to be at the same time the first reality, God as the first and the last, the Alpha and Omega. Without God, all seeing and perceiving of things and laws become abstraction, a separation from both origin and goal.**’

### ‘Why do we need the vertical line between us and God. Is not the horizontal lines between humans (humanism) enough?

- “There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looks to Him and bad when it turns from Him.”
- “No person knows how bad they are till they have tried very hard to be good.”
- “If a person thinks they are not conceited, they are very conceited indeed.”
- “Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.”
- “When you are arguing against God you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all.”
- “Human history is the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.”
- “Christianity, if false, is of no importance and, if true, is of infinite importance. The one thing it cannot be is moderately important.”
