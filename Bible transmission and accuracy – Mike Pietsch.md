## The accuracy of the Christian (and Jewish) Scriptures

### 1\. Diversity and unity

Approximately 35 authors wrote 66 books over a period of approximately 1500+ years. Significant consistency and harmony points to an overarching author — ie. God/Holy Spirit.

### 2\. Realistic, down-to-earth nature of the Bible

The Bible does not ‘pull any punches’, nor gloss over faults and problems of its leaders or people, e.g. Moses (the murderer), Aaron (rebelled against Moses), David (much blood on his hands and also a wife-stealer/ adulterer and murderer), Solomon (seduced by his many wives despite his wisdom), Peter (denies Jesus within 12 hours of boldly saying that he was prepared to die with Jesus), Thomas (doubted the resurrection of Jesus), disciples/apostles (fled and hid in a cowardly manner), Saul/Paul (persecuted ruthlessly the early Christians).

### 3\. Fulfilled prophesies (Deuteronomy 18:18-22)

(a) Messianic —— Micah 5:2; Isaiah 52:13 – 53:12

(b) Historical —— Deuteronomy 28:25; Hosea 9:17

### 4\. Transmission of the text

#### (i) Discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls

Up until 1940, the oldest manuscript of the Hebrew Scriptures that existed was the **Massoretic text** (1,000 AD). So there was much speculation that the OT text might have been corrupted or modified by the Medieval church or monks in the first millennium of Christianity, especially with regard to references to the coming Messiah in the Old Testament.

However, soon after WWII a shepherd boy discovered a number of clay jars in a cave near the Dead Sea in Israel which contained many manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures as well as manuscripts from the **Qumran community** who had preserved all these documents when Israel was finally overrun by the Romans, soon after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. The manuscripts have been shown without doubt to date back to 150 BC and so pre-date the New Testament era. They include parts of every OT book except Esther. This dismissed the many theological theories about the text being modified or tampered with by the early church, because it is amazing how accurately transmitted the Hebrew text was, demonstrating the meticulous work of Jewish and Christian scribes.

#### (ii) NT documents – earliest extant approximately 110-130AD – few verses from John’s Gospel.

Approximately 200AD – John chapters 1 – 14.

350AD – total Bible – Codex **Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.**

Additionally, 1000s of other fragments and remnants from these early centuries (including translations).

#### (iii) Comparable historical documents:

1. Caesar’s “Gallic War” – 9 or 10 good manuscripts exist, the oldest one dates to 800AD.
2. History of Thucydides and Herodotus – earliest manuscript is dated around 900AD when the events occurred around 400 – 460BC.
3. 1450 years in between the writings of Aristotle and the earliest text that we still have.

### Types of modifications/ mistakes and how to detect them

1. **Unintentional changes**:  
	poorer eyesight, similar or the same word can lead to a skipping of the text, or a word might sound like another word if it is being copied aurally.
2. **Intentional changes:**  
	This can happen when the scribe is not just being a scribe, but also a thinking person who also has their own logic and theology. So ‘faulty’ grammar or spelling or added words for clarification are included; harmonisation of passages to conform to other passages or previous references (eg Luke’s version of the Lord’s Prayer to Matthew’s version); clarification with reference to geography or spelling of names; occasionally a very slight modification theologically or doctrinally.
3. **External evidence**  
	of many texts can often show from earlier texts how and when these modifications have occurred. There are multiple groups of texts, some of which are more accurate or earlier than others.
4. **Internal evidence**  
	uses the knowledge of how these mistakes can occur and can trace the natural occurrence of these events. Other internal evidence uses the principle of taking the more difficult reading, which is more likely to have been ‘smoothed out’ by the scribe than having been made more difficult by the scribe.

**Examples:**  
Mark 1:1 has the omission or inclusion of ‘the Son of God’.  
Compare Mark 15:39, Mark 16:9-20, Isa 7:14

> ‘There are good grounds for retaining confidence in the accuracy of our NT translations. First, the numerous manuscripts which have been preserved until the present day provide scholars with an unparalleled body of evidence upon which to base their judgements. Secondly, while different from each other in some (often very minor) respects, the extant manuscripts present a remarkable consistent testimony to the original text of the NT. Thirdly, no variant readings require modification of a fundamental point of Christian doctrine or ethics. While ‘absolute certainty’ is not available to us, the number and broad agreement of the extant manuscripts give us strong grounds for the view that we can know with great confidence the text of the original autographs \[original manuscripts\].’

### 5\. Critical Opposition to early Church.

There was critical and public opposition immediately after Jesus’ death and resurrection. This initially came especially from the Jews with whom the early Christians had close contact. Later the Romans also were very critical at various times. Hence, there was real pressure to record all events very accurately and honestly. Also, in the face of all this opposition the early church leaders suffered, not profiting financially, personally, or gaining honour and power, but rather poverty, scorn, imprisonment and death.

### 6\. Oral to Written

Jesus

(oral tradition) briefly recorded texts Gospels

30 AD eg. Q source (Quelle)Mark (65AD) (Peter)

1 – 5 years after Christ

Matthew (75 AD)

Luke (75 AD

Epistles (49-65 AD)

Galatians

1 Cor (15 especially)

John (90AD)

The ancient memory was far superior and well trained compared to today when we rely on books and more recently all of the technological information storage. For example, people were able to memorise and recite Homer’s Odyssey and the Illiad which consists of 24,000 lines of poetry.

### 7\. Canon

- OT — (Excluding apochrypha) approx 110AD (Jewish Synod of Jamnia)
- NT — internal and external evidence
1. **apostolic authority** (eg. Paul, Peter) cf. 2 Peter 3:2, 15, 16
2. **Used in churches and had consistency**.  
	Initially, the 20 main books of the first century were well and truly accepted by everyone. Seven were discussed as to their authenticity due to the fact that they were not absolutely sure who wrote them, namely Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation. The third category that were not accepted at all were mostly Gnostic variations of the Christian message which were written after the first century and often used pseudonyms to give them credibility. They were often rehashes of the earlier documents of the New Testament, and they also took advantage of the aspects of Jesus life that were not central and covered little by the original accounts. This includes Jesus boyhood, his adulthood before he began his ministry and so on. Many of these were discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in about 1947 and include other ‘Gospels’ such as the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, Gospel of Mary, the Secret Gospel of Mark, etc.

The 27 books of the NT canon was finally decided by a Synodical Council in the fourth century, but essentially what it did was confirm what had been accepted and happening de facto for the previous three centuries by the vast majority of the early Christian church.

The following quotes describe this in the following way:

> “…the canon is a list of authoritative books more than it is an authoritative list of books. These books didn’t derive their authority from being selected; each one was authoritative before anyone gathered them together”

> “The most travelled roads in Europe are the best roads; that’s why they’re so heavily travelled”

> “It is the simple truth to say that the NT books became canonical because no one could stop them doing so.”

### 8\. Archaeology

Continues to support and validate the biblical evidence – eg. through pollen grains in core of sediment from Lake Galilee.

Archeologist Dr Nelson Glueck, probably the greatest modern authority on Israeli archaeology, commented,

> “No archeological discovery has ever controverted the a biblical reference. Scores of archeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible.”
