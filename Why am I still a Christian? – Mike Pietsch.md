**Sermon for Pentecost 21 (25 <sup>th</sup> of October, 2020)**

### Introduction

This evening I am speaking with the Young Adults of the congregation at their monthly meeting.

Each month, up to a dozen young adults get together to chat about **“Life, the universe and everything”** over some food, beer and wine. Our topic last month involved me answering the question: **“Why am I still a Lutheran?”** This flowed out of one conversation about the church and why it has so many different denominations. Tonight’s topic which I will be responding to is: **“Why am I still a Christian?”**

Our Gospel reading for today throws up many of these questions and answers about this topic, so I thought it might be helpful to share with you this morning why I am still a Christian. As I answer this question, you might like to be asking yourself as to why you are still a Christian or follower of Jesus Christ.

### The universe just came from nothing?

I cannot find a better alternative to the idea that there might be a ‘god’ or ‘creator’ somewhere out there. The alternative idea that all of the universe just came from nothing is both unscientific, illogical and no better than believing in fairies. Science tells us that something cannot come from nothing. There is always a cause or a transformation of matter from one thing to another.

I have not heard a satisfactory explanation as to why anything exists at all. ‘Why is the world here?’ ‘Why do I exist?’ ‘Did the universe just come from out of nowhere?’ By contrast, if there is a ‘god’ or ‘creator’ out there, then the world starts to make some sort of sense. Otherwise, this thing that I call ‘Mike Pietsch the human being’, is just a pile of electrons, chemical reactions and a bit of dirt. I cannot believe that the people around me are just walking computers without hearts and love and feelings and music and fun. I do not want to live in a world without any of these beautiful and precious aspects of what it means to be a human being.

And in today’s Gospel (Matthew 22:34-46), Jesus nails it by saying that love is the most important thing in all of the world. In the first five books of the Bible, written by Moses, there are not just 10 commandments, but 613 commandments. The exciting thing is that Jesus invites us to partner with him in dynamically living out our lives with just two of these commandments: firstly, love God, and at the same time love every other human we meet and live with. This sounds great, but it is impossible to do without the love and help of God and Jesus, because we cannot just love all other people without help. We need God’s vision of other people, as well as his love and partnership in our daily lives.

### Jesus

The next thing that makes me still a Christian is the person Jesus. He is so loving of everybody, but also super critical of the hypocrites who thought they were better than other people. He shot them right down as he does in the Gospel passage we heard today. This is the final round of debating which Jesus uses to ‘call their game’ before he heads for the cross where he was to die for all of the world, for you and me, and even for these religious leaders who were looking for ways to kill him. Jesus headed for Jerusalem and the cross to demonstrate that a person who genuinely loves another person is prepared to give up their life for them.

Jesus’ love put us first. He is prepared to risk his life for all those he loves, including his enemies. He ‘walks the talk’ and is far more than a religious teacher or guru or prophet. Our passage throws the challenge open to the Jewish leaders to contemplate that Jesus, who was a descendant of King David, might actually be the Messiah. He is the Lord of the world and could have commanded a host of angels to rescue him, but as the Messiah he humbly and lovingly allows himself to be crucified for you and me. But then we have the exciting news that he was raised from the dead, for you and me.

Another reason why I follow Jesus is because he cannot be manipulated. He meets us at one point in a very human way but then switches the tables around so that we feel totally loved by him, but at the same time we recognise that we do not at all deserve to be in his presence. He does this all the time when he is with people. He switches the tables all the time in instances that we call paradoxes.

This means that when we approach Jesus to grab hold of him or to understand him or even to use him, he slips off to the side or appears in a totally different place to where we expect him. He has done this since his birth, from the time when he arrived as a little baby in a run-down stable in a manger. What sort of an entrance into the world is this for a king and Messiah? How can God make himself to weak, innocent and vulnerable yet be able to hold the universe in his hand. I love that line in the song ‘Servant King’, which says about Jesus’ hands: ‘Hands that flung stars into space, to cruel nails surrendered.’ The very hands that made the universe are now hanging pierced and bleeding and ripped by the nails tying him to the beam of the cross.

### Find God UP there

Another reason why I am still a follower of this man Jesus is because rather than calling me to climb the mountain to find God UP there, he came down into my world and says, ‘hey I am down here in the ‘mud and the blood and the beer’. This is a compassionate God who knows what it is to love and suffer. He knows that we cannot lift ourselves up to God by our own boot straps. Jesus is not a guru showing us the path we must follow to try and find Paradise or Nirvana. Jesus stands next to us and says: ‘I want to carry you home with me to my place forever. I have already prepared a place for you.’ We affirmed that today for Hannah when she was baptised. This is God’s gift to us from the start. It is what gets us up out of bed each day, knowing that we are loved.

30% of people in the world profess that they are Christians: Followers of Christ. That is two and a half billion people! There is no other person in the world that has ever lived with such a following. Are they all stupid? Are they all duped? By contrast, there is a very high percentage of Christians who are highly educated and do not easily follow any and every idea. They are a critical group of educated people who have thoroughly checked out Jesus’ credentials and his history and his authenticity. They have researched the Bible itself and checked out how it fits in with archaeology and science, legal systems of the day and in the translated transmission of the Bible down to us today. Jesus and the Bible have been turned inside out to see how genuine they are, and they have a huge credibility.

When I am despairing about life and faith, I hear the words of Peter who says: ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.’ This was Peter’s response to Jesus’ question when some of Jesus’ disciples were leaving him at the end of John 6. I ask myself: ‘Who else provides life like Jesus? He stands head and shoulders above every other religious leader or politician or philosopher.’

But then Jesus turns the tables on me again. I think that I am making a choice for him and the Christian faith. But then I hear Jesus’ words: ‘I have chosen you, Mike, before you were even born. You just need to accept my choice of you and my invitation for you to be my follower.’ Jesus invites everyone here today in this church to accept his loving invitation to keep following him. This morning we celebrated God’s choice of Hannah in her baptism. In this God called her to be his child and disciple and to receive all the love that God wants to pour into her life. What is central and vital in your life? Where do you find that ultimate and precious love that we all need? Even though I try and do it in my own strength, I keep being drawn back by God’s Holy Spirit to confess that I find true life is found in the person of Jesus Christ, which is why I am still a Christian.
