In the discussion responding to Pastor Andrew Jaensch’s article, it may be helpful to hear a more balanced statement with reference to the understanding of the Word of God in the Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA).

This parallels the dual identity of Jesus with the dual identity of the Bible. It states that mystically and paradoxically, Jesus was 100% divine and 100% human. In the same way, the Bible is 100% divine and 100% human.

God enabled many frail and sinful human beings to be the authors of the Bible over a long period of time, approximately 1500 years. It was not handed down from heaven on golden tablets as supposedly was the Book of Mormon or as with the supposedly heavenly dictated Koran.

It came down through history on parchments and was passed on from generation to generation. It was written using logical and linguistic techniques in many different historical and social contexts, all of which can be analysed and examined from a human perspective. But we need to acknowledge that our human analysis has limitations. (A prime example is the discovery of the **Dead Sea Scrolls** which blew away decades of theological assumptions about the Bible.)

So the Bible needs to be heard not only as the words of people, but as the Word of God. Ultimately, we need to allow God to use our reading of the Bible to engage and shape our hearts, lives and church and world through our encounter with the risen Christ and the leading of the Holy Spirit.
