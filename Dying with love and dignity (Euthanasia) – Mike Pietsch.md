A Sydney university academic (whose name I cannot currently remember) spoke and wrote several years ago about the far better solution to the prolonged agony that is often created by Western medicine.

Too often, patients are in the hands of doctors who only think of healing and not of allowing people to die with love and compassion in the hands and love of increasingly capable and personable hospices. If the money spent on expensive and unnecessary medical procedures in the last months of people’s lives was redirected to hospices, a great deal of the current inhumanity could be avoided. I see this as a far more caring way of dealing lovingly with those who are dying than the legally problematic minefield of so-called assisted suicide.

We in the western world need to regain a more natural and accepting attitude to death and see it a part of the life process, but in reverse. We cannot control our birth nor our death, but we can use our medical and counselling procedures to facilitate the betterment of both birth and death (and all of life in between).

The western world needs to regain its maturity and realise that it cannot control everything in life. Life is a gift to be received and cared for with utmost respect for both the individual and the community that surrounds that individual. Allowing love and compassion to be the dominant factors in the face of death is far more powerful than pressing a button to kill oneself because you cannot face your own demise, or the possible reality that you are supposedly a ‘burden’ to society or your family and friends. Assisted suicide can be a cop out by a society that does not have the time or compassion to be with and accept the person who is dying.

True dying with dignity is dying surrounded by people who love you, whether they are your family, friends or the caring staff in a hospice. It is never easy or pretty, but it is far more humane and loving than expecting or pushing the person to see suicide as the only way out because the situation has got very difficult. The rider that I leave you with is that I do not have a problem with allowing a person to die by removing unnecessary life supports when it has become obvious to all that the person may need to be given the space to die. The pain of their death can be minimised by well controlled pain-relieving drugs and a loving and caring community surrounding them until the end.
