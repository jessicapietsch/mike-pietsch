### Paradoxes

Like Luther, Bonhoeffer frequently uses paradoxes to convey theological truths. The most central are **God’s incarnation** (Jesus is fully God and fully human) and the **subsequent death of God** (in Jesus).

In German, the noun ‘Dietrich’ means ‘skeleton key’, which can be used for good and for evil. So also with paradoxes. If only one side of the paradox is emphasised it becomes a false half truth. Only when both sides of the paradox are held together equally are they an accurate description of truth and reality.

Somewhat playfully I refer to Bonhoeffer’s paradoxes as ‘ **bonbons** ’. Pulling on both sides at the same time can often produce a surprising ‘bang’ or ‘Aha’ moment. Referring to the tension between Jesus’ body being in heaven at the right hand of God and simultaneously on earth in the church (Christ’s body),

Bonhoeffer says:

> **‘High tensions produce big sparks… I’ve had a special affection for the season between Easter and Ascension Day. Here’s another great tension. How can people stand earthly tensions if they know nothing of the tension between heaven and earth?**

Explaining this he says:

**‘Between his ascension and his coming again the Church is his form and indeed his only form. That he is in heaven at the right hand of God does not contradict this; on the contrary, this is what makes possible his presence in and as the Church.’**

Another ‘bonbon’ says:

> **‘We find both these courses, planning for the future or living for the day, equally impossible. There remains for us only the very narrow way…of living every day as if it were our last, and yet living in faith and responsibility as though there were to be a great future…Thinking and acting for the sake of the coming generation, but being ready to go any day without fear or anxiety.’**

With respect to both the narrowness and breadth of the Confessing Church in Germany, which stood up against Hitler, Bonhoeffer cites these statements of Christ: ‘ *Whoever is not against us is for us* ’ (Mk 9:40) and ‘ *Whoever is not for me is against me* ’ (Matt 13:30).

Summarily Bonhoeffer says:

> **‘The more exclusively we recognize and confess Christ as our Lord, the more will be disclosed to us the breadth of Christ’s Lordship.’**

Elsewhere he says:

> **‘Today it seems so difficult to walk with certainty the narrow path of the church’s decision \[of exclusion\] and yet to remain wide open to Christ’s love for all people … (Tit 3:4) for the weak and godless. Still, both must remain together, or else we will follow merely human paths.**

And finally:

> **‘Dostoievsky let the figure of Christ appear in Russian literature as the idiot….He does not go around with the great ones, but with children. He is laughed at and loved. He is the fool and he is the wise man….He is revolutionary and yet he conforms. He does not want to—but he does—call attention to himself just by his existence. Who are you? Idiot or Christ?’**

This paradoxical tension reflects Bonhoeffer’s theology and life.

### Quotes from Dietrich Bonhoeffer

The following quotes from Bonhoeffer express further paradoxes that stretch us as Christians as we hold them in tension. May you be blessed as you are stretched.

> **From his reading of the OT Bonhoeffer had come to learn that “it is only when one knows the unutterability of the name of God that one can utter the name of Jesus Christ”**.

> **The disciple is dragged out of his relative security into a life of absolute insecurity…from a life which is observable and calculable into a life where everything is unobservable and fortuitous…Again, it is no universal law…Rather it is the exact opposite of all legality. It is nothing less than bondage to Christ alone, completely breaking through every programme, every ideal, every set of laws…Besides Jesus nothing has any significance.**

> **The Christian must live a ‘secular’ life, and thereby share in God’s sufferings….To be a Christian does not mean to be religious in a particular way but to be a person–not a type of person, but that person that Christ creates in us.**.

> **His understanding of freedom is paradoxical as in the statement that ‘only through discipline may a person learn to be free’ and valiantly grasping occasions, not cravenly doubting–freedom comes only through deeds, not through thoughts taking wing. Faint not nor fear, but go out to the storm and the action, trusting in God whose commandment you faithfully follow; freedom, exultant, will welcome your spirit with joy.**

> **We are not Christ, but if we want to be Christians, we must have some share in Christ’s large-heartedness by acting with responsibility and in freedom when the hour of danger comes, and by showing a real sympathy that springs, not from fear, but from the liberating and redeeming love of Christ for all who suffer. Mere waiting and looking on is not Christian behaviour. The Christian is called to sympathy and action, not in the first place by his own sufferings, but by the sufferings of his brothers and sisters, for whose sake Christ suffered.**

> **“We…must take our share of responsibility for the moulding of history in every situation and at every moment…”**

> **“should the leader ‘allow himself to succumb to the wishes of those he leads, who will always seek to turn him into their idol, then the image of the leader will gradually become the image of the ‘misleader’…This is the leader who makes an idol of himself and his office, and who thus mocks God’.”**

> **“The church is the church only when it exists for others. To make a start, it should give away all it’s property to those in need. The clergy must live solely on the free-will offerings of their congregations, or possibly engage in some secular calling. The church must share in the secular problems of ordinary human life, not dominating, but helping and serving. It must tell people of every calling what it means to live in Christ, to exist for others. In particular, our own church will have to take the field against the vices of hubris, power-worship, envy, and humbug, as the roots of all evil. It will have to speak of moderation, purity, trust, loyalty, constancy, patience, discipline, humility, contentment, and modesty. It must not under-estimate the importance of human example (which has its origin in the humanity of Jesus and is so important in Paul’s teaching); it is not abstract argument but example, that gives its word emphasis and power. (I hope to take up later this subject of ‘example’ and its place in the New Testament; it is something that we have almost entirely forgotten.)**

> **“a person’s own goodness is now concealed from themself. It is not merely that they are no longer obliged to be the judge of their goodness; they must no longer desire to know of it!”**

> **“consequently our self-examination will always consist precisely in our delivering ourselves up entirely to the judgement of Jesus Christ, not computing the reckoning ourselves but committing it to Him of whom we know and acknowledge that He is in ourselves.”**

> **“Love, therefore, is the name for what God does to a person, in overcoming the disunion in which a person lives….And so love is something which happens to a person, something passive, something over which a person does not dispose, simply because it lies beyond a person’s existence in disunion. Love means the undergoing of the transformation of one’s entire existence by God; it means being drawn into the world as it must live before God and in God. Love, therefore, is not a person’s choice, but it is the election of humanity by God.”**

> In one of his catechisms Bonhoeffer depicts the new relationship in this way: **‘Here God rouses you from sleep to sobriety, from restriction to openness, from servitude to freedom. Here you daily give yourself up and become master of all things in the discipleship of Christ’.**

> **… To be a Christian does not mean to be religious in a particular way, to make something of oneself (a sinner, a penitent, or a saint) on the basis of some method or other, but to be a person—not a type of person, but that person that Christ creates in us.**

> **“… it is only by living completely in this world that one learns to have faith. One must completely abandon any attempt to make something of oneself, whether it be a saint, or a converted sinner, or a churchman (a so-called priestly type!), a righteous person or an unrighteous one, a sick or healthy one. By this-worldliness I mean living unreservedly in life’s duties, problems, successes and failures, experiences and perplexities. In so doing we throw ourselves completely into the arms of God, taking seriously, not our own sufferings, but those of God in the world—watching with Christ in Gethsemane. That, I think, is faith; that is *metanoia*; and that is how one becomes a person and a Christian.”** (*Letters and Papers from Prison* 369, 370)

> **“Faith is participation in this being of Jesus (incarnation, cross, resurrection). Our relation to God is not a ‘religious’ relationship to the highest, most powerful, and best Being imaginable–that is not authentic transcendence–but our relation to God is in a new life in ‘existence for others’, through participation in the being of Jesus. The transcendental is not infinite and unattainable tasks, but the neighbour who is within reach in any given situation. God in human form…’the person for others’.**

> **“Nietzsche says that ‘every profound mind has need of a mask’. In my view ‘telling the truth’ means saying how something is in reality, ie respect for secrecy, confidence and concealment. ‘Betrayal’, for example, is not truth; nor are frivolity, cynicism, etc. What is concealed must be disclosed only at confession, ie before God.’”**

> **“Only now are the Germans beginning to discover the meaning of free responsibility. It depends on a God who demands responsible action in a bold venture of faith, and who promises forgiveness and consolation to the person who becomes a sinner in that venture.”**

> **The pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner. So everyone must conceal his sin from himself and from the fellowship. We dare not be sinners. Many Christians are unthinkably horrified when a sinner is discovered among the righteous. So we remain alone with our sin, living in lies and hypocrisy. The fact is that we are sinners!**

> **Christian fellowship is not an ideal which we must realise; it is rather a reality created by God in Christ in which we may participate. The more clearly we learn to recognise that the ground and strength and promise of all our fellowship is in Jesus Christ alone, the more serenely shall we think of our fellowship and pray and hope for it.**

> **“during the last year or so I’ve come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity. The Christian is not a ‘religious being’, but simply a person, as Jesus was a person.”**
