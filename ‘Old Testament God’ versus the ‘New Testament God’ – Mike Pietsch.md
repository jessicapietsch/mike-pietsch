Ever since the New Testament was written there has been discussion, dispute and even division over the question of reconciling the Old Testament with the New Testament. This question was formally addressed by **Marcion** in the second century AD who rejected the vast majority of the Old Testament and also took out parts of the New Testament that referred to the Old Testament too much.

They, and various others, have done so for some or all the following reasons:

1. The Old Testament often exhibits the anger of God against both his own people and the people of other nations around Israel.
2. In the Old Testament God seems to be very self-centred or preoccupied with people worshipping him by contrast with the far less self-centred approach of the New Testament.
3. God on a number of occasions calls for the outright killing of seemingly innocent people, whereas the God of the New Testament only or primarily speaks of loving your neighbour and even your enemy.
4. Some of the bizarre and gross occurrences in the book of Judges with Samson and the abused concubine of the Levite.

The following points, however, I believe, offer **a more balanced and wholistic approach to Scripture** as a whole.

1. Jesus often quotes and refers to the Old Testament in many of his sayings and in his teaching. He also encourages people to continue to fulfil the laws and expectations of the Old Testament as prescribed by the Jewish priests and teachers of the Law.
2. The ‘Father’ to whom Jesus refers is the God of the Old Testament’ (Yahweh, The LORD).
3. The New Testament has countless direct quotes, indirect quotes, allusions and assumptions from the Old Testament. It is like the Old Testament is the part of the iceberg under the sea (90%) and the New Testament is the 10% above the water-line. Another image is that the Old Testament is like the cake part of the fruit cake, and the New Testament is the white icing.
4. St Paul was a brilliant and up-and-coming young Old Testament theologian and Jewish rabbinical teacher before he became a Christian. But once he was a Christian he re-understood Jesus in the light of the Old Testament and continued to use it in his preaching and teaching, with almost all of his examples of faith coming from there. This resulted in amazing passages such as his description of love in 1 Corinthians 13!
5. There is a superficial understanding of the differences between the two testaments which says that the Old Testament is the LAW and the New Testament is the GOSPEL. This idea comes from a very narrow reading of the two testaments, only seeing the more difficult texts. In fact, there is a great deal of Gospel in the OT and there is a great deal of law in the NT.

### Theory of gradual revelation:

This concept admits that there are nevertheless some differences and inconsistencies between the two testaments. They can partly be explained by the fact that God could not reveal the full extent of the Gospel to Adam and Eve immediately after they had sinned.

In the same way, Jesus could not reveal fully the implications of his coming to his Twelve Disciples at the beginning because they and the crowd would have probably not believed him and thought that he was a nut-case. Even when Jesus was gradually revealing the message of the Gospel to them, his own disciples were continually ‘not getting it’.

Likewise for the people in the Old Testament, God started with them at the point where they were, which included their limited understanding as well as their misguided and lop-sided interpretation of the world. This would include their almost abusive treatment of women (which is gradually being transformed in the NT) as well as their narrow idea that God was only on their side.

God allowed himself to start with the children of Israel’s limited understanding of the world, and then using this moved them on to a deeper and more complete understanding of life. But there are many amazing and in depth insights in the OT which both point to the coming Messiah and also show that many of the prophets in the OT had deep insights to share and pass down the ages.

### Some questions:

Nevertheless, there are still some very difficult parts of the Old Testament to understand, and we should all have our list of these questions to ask pastors and theologians as well as ultimately God, when we get to heaven. But we might also need to step back from some of our questions.

**First**, just because WE do not understand how it all fits together does not mean that we have all the information about the background and circumstances in which this all occurred, and so we have to be prepared (either in this world or the next) for our questions to be limited or naïve or just wrong.

**Secondly**, we have to weigh up how important these questions are in relation to the many clear and wonderful messages in the rest of Scripture. It is quite amazing how God has passed on his message of love and grace (as well as the law) throughout the 1,500 years during which time the Bible was written by many and diverse authors. When we step back and see the big picture, it all hangs together. So we can see the forest rather than just the individual trees.

### The Questioner:

When we receive these questions from other people, it might tell us more about their experience with the church or a negative version of Christianity that they have experienced. It might be good to ask them what their view of God or faith is like, or which parts of the Bible they identify with or appreciate. Often God starts with us at one point in our understanding of who he is and leads us along the way to a more complete view of God. But as we know, none of us ever has a complete view of God, let alone one that is perfectly accurate. But we continue to open ourselves to these questions and to the Spirit who speaks through the Word of God as well as through the body of Christ.
