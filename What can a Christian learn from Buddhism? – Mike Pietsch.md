### Introduction

The following list of questions have been formulated during my recent trip through SE Asia during which time I read several books about Buddhism. The response to these questions will be given by the **Buddhist chaplain to Flinders University, George Gatenby**. They have been put together so that George can help me to better understand what Buddhism is about.

I am gradually learning that Buddhism takes on quite diverse forms depending on which Buddhist school it is from and also from which part of the world it originates and also how the Western world has modified it for its own use. These questions to George will form a springboard to focus on my understandings and misunderstandings of the Buddhist faith. Being a Christian I will also be trying to understand what is similar and what is different between the two faiths.

A summary of George’s responses to these questions will be presented in the first sessions at Adelaide uni and then in the second session at Flinders where the discussion will continue. Please feel very welcome to be part of this engaging process.

### Questions from Mike

#### Is there any affirmation or celebration of the created world, as we know it?

Not that I am aware of. All created things are characterised by suffering (*dhukha*), not-self (*anatman*) and impermanence (*anitya*). In order to find salvation we cannot rely on that which is impermanent. On the other hand not-self and the law of karma also signify inter-connectedness. We are essentially one with all living things. However, that brings a sense of fellow feeling and empathy rather than celebration.

#### How does Buddhism explain the existence of matter and life? Is there a place for a Creator?

The Buddha Dharma (the ‘Dharma of the Buddhas’ or ‘The Way of Enlightenment’) does not seek to account for these things because it does not regard them as relevant for salvation. Gautama Buddha in the *Parable of the Poisoned Arrow* gave a thorough explanation of this. The only thing that Gautama Buddha revered was ‘ *Dharma* ’ (the law of existence or the way) – similar to the Indian idea of ‘self’ or, in Chinese philosophy, of ‘Tao’.

#### Now that Buddha has entered Nirvana, does he exist any longer?

The extinction (*nirodha*) aspect of nirvana means ‘the extinction of passions (*kleshas*)’, which bind us to the round of birth and death because they are blind or ‘ignorant’ (*avidya*). The Tathagata (Buddha) fills all things. Nirvana is also called purity, self, permanence and bliss. Buddha, enlightenment and nirvana are the same thing and they are eternal. Gautama Buddha (a.k.a. Shakyamuni Buddha) was the living manifestation in time and space of these things on earth.

#### To what extent did Buddha want himself to be worshipped? Is he worshipped like a god? What does Buddha have to say about the worship of various gods and deities?

I can’t think of any occasion on which the Gautama said he should be worshipped. However, in India all people and beings were traditionally shown respect by the gesture, ‘ *anjali* ’, the joining of hands, which is a worshipful posture. This is especially so for great sages and men and women of love and compassion, which are the principal Buddhist virtues due to the fact that we are all part of the same living organism and not ultimately enduring independent entities (not-self: *anatman*).

The Buddha Dharma accepts the existence of gods and teaches the respect for them and that they be afforded the compassion that is at the heart of the Buddha Dharma. Buddhists do not argue about religion or criticise other peoples’ faith. It is a serious offence since it causes great hurt and pain to people.

Gautama taught his disciples to respect the ancient shrines and the faith and beliefs of others. The great Buddhist Indian emperor Ashoka (3 <sup>rd</sup> C BC) provided for all religions in his kingdom and that is very much in keeping with the spirit of generosity and compassionate respect that is central the way.

#### Does Buddhism have the concept of a deity?

Buddhism accepts that many life forms exist, including gods and spirits. All should be treated with love, respect and compassion.

#### Is Buddhism a form of humanistic ethics?

No. Buddhism is a way to salvation from ‘ *samsara* ’ the round of birth-and-death’ and the realisation of absolute liberation (*moksha*) and absolute happiness (*nirvana*).

#### Is Buddhism a philosophy of life that is primary morals/ ethics which has a negative view of this worldly existence?

Buddhism is a sophisticated universal culture with a history of 2,500 years. It includes philosophical and religious aspects. It is not primarily concerned with ethics but liberation for oneself and others, which may sound like negativity – especially to materialists or humanists. The rules of deportment for clergy are designed to avoid the community (*sasana*) bringing disgrace upon itself. The ‘Ten Good Actions’ (*dasa kusala karma*) are simply considered to be the basis of decent human behaviour and will have an outcome most likely to be rebirth as human beings because that affords the best chance to follow the Dharma.

They are

1. not to kill,
2. not to steal,
3. not to commit adultery,
4. not to tell a lie,
5. not to be duplicitous,
6. not to slander,
7. not to equivocate,
8. not to be covetous,
9. not to be angry,
10. not to hold wrong views

#### Is it a philosophy that can readily be adopted and form an amalgam with other philosophies and religions?

Some thinkers find useful aspects of Buddhist practice that can be extracted and used for their own purposes – e.g., ‘mindfulness’ in the case of psychology and counselling; meditational practices etc. Also some Buddhist philosophers draw on external philosophy to bolster their own – e.g., the famous reformer of the early 20 <sup>th</sup> century, **Manshi Kiyozawa** adopted aspects of Stoicism (Epictetus) in his thinking. Some Shin Buddhist theologians have drawn on the ideas of Bultmann, and Whitehead, for example.

#### Is karma the equivalent of ‘sin’?

‘Karma’ means ‘action’ – good, bad or indifferent. It is a cardinal principle of Buddhism that actions bring results. The old Buddhist adage runs: ‘Good deeds (*kusala karma*) bring good results; bad deeds (*akusala karma*) bring bad results; my deeds (*karma*) bring my results (*vipaka*).’ I personally like this teaching because it teaches us to be adult and mature and take responsibility for our actions. The outcome of  *karma*  (actions) is called  *vipaka*  (results). It is wrong to speak of karma as the result. *Karma* only means action.

However, Gotama taught that ‘the range of *karma* ’ is imponderable. Only an enlightened person can account for the causes of the things that we live through now. Furthermore the result of  *karma*  is more than anything how we are placed in relation to being able to hear and practice Buddha Dharma, which is the ultimate ‘good’ (*kusala*) result (*vipaka*). Things like natural disasters are caused by mindless physical processes and not the result of karma.

Buddhist morality is not entirely tied to questions of karma because it is ‘other-regarding’ and autonomous. The basic rule-of-thumb (equivalent to the ‘Golden Rule’ in Confucianism – ‘Do not do to others what you would not want done to you’) is taken from the Buddha’s ‘ *Advice to Rahula* ’, his son. This is that we should first ponder our actions and be mindful of them, then consider what harm they may cause. If they cause harm just to us that is bad but not as serious as if it causes harm to others or both us and others. ‘Harm’ (*himsa*) in Buddhism means anything that hurts another being physically or mentally. It is regarded as a monstrous wrongdoing at all times.

#### Did Buddha believe that we are born with karma (sin)?

As I have explained our birth is a result of past *karma*  (actions). It is especially auspicious if we are born in a way that we can practice Buddhism. The basic practice in Buddhism based on not-self is to be generous and liberal. We are not born either good or bad but we are only a bundle of potential with possible pre-ordained limitations. All beings have Buddha-nature (*buddha-ta*) and have the potential to realise enlightenment.

#### Who is making judgements about our merits (and wrongs) and keeping a tally so that we know where we are up to on the scale of sins and merits?

No one. We are responsible for ourselves.

#### What are the chances of getting out of the cycle of karma?

The entire purpose of the Buddha Dharma is to break free from the thrall of karma. There are many paths in Buddhism because Gautama taught many different people under many differing circumstances. He also took up the task of teaching specifically to lead people to liberation from birth-and-death, with no exceptions. We are exhorted to weigh our own capacities and find the way that best suits our circumstances and us. Some people abandon worldly life and become monks and nuns – seeking enlightenment that way; others remain in the world and follow a way that the Buddha taught to householders.

#### What ‘hope’ does a Buddhist person have?

Every hope of salvation if he/she follows the way. Since impermanence is a cardinal rule of existence nothing is fixed and can change.

#### What is the meaning of ‘hope’ for a Buddhist?

This is a tricky question because we are happier, according to Buddhism if we live in the present. If we worry about the future we will exhaust ourselves in needless effort or we will be disappointed if we expect unrealistic things – for example that we are not impermanent and will not suffer and die.

#### To what extent is the Buddhist eight-fold path an equivalent of the Old Testament Law?

The eightfold path was discovered by Gotama Buddha during his struggle to gain enlightenment. Its essence is the middle way – rejection of asceticism or religious beliefs and practices that will do us psychological or physical harms and, on the other hand, self-indulgence. It is hard to see a connection with Old Testament law. It is ‘dharma’, which is the only thing that Gotama revered.

#### Does the merit-earning of Buddhism mean that when one does good to others that you are partly/ primarily doing good for your own merit-earning rather than focussing on the needs of the other person in need, or whom you are loving?

Merit earning (*parinama*) is always given away to other beings; it is for both ourselves and others. This is called the *bodhisattva* vocation: to gain enlightenment for ourselves and others. For example, a person who has become a Buddha can save others with the absolute power of his merit or virtue through the means that he/she has chosen. I have heard people speak as though they have earned merit for themselves, but Buddhism teaches only liberality and generosity. People who think that way are not Buddhists at heart.

#### What does Buddha teach about ‘hell’? Did Buddha teach about reincarnation or is this an influence that has spilled over from Hinduism?

Buddhism accepts that hell exists but like all conditioned things it is impermanent.

Buddhism sees the human personality as a construction made up of various factors (*skhandas*); they are in a constant state of flux, forming and re-forming every moment. Death and birth are just part of the process. Reincarnation is based on the idea of a ‘transmigrating discrete self’, which Buddhism rejects.

#### Did Buddha anticipate a greater religious figure to follow him (i.e. Maitreya or a person like Jesus?).

The Buddha acknowledged the existence of many other Buddhas, including Maitreya, who was a disciple named Ajita. They all share the same enlightenment and teach the same dharma. There are Buddhas of the past, present and future. In Pure Land Buddhism, for example, the present Buddha is Amida – the Buddha of Infinite Light and Life. There are no ‘greater’ figures amongst Buddhas because they all share the same enlightenment and are characterised as equal.

#### If so, is Buddha like John the Baptist pointing to the coming Messiah?

Before his death (*parinirvana*) Gautama Buddha said that his teaching is complete in itself. He clearly and unequivocally pointed only to Dharma as our refuge.

#### Can you be a Buddhist Christian like being a Messianic Jew (ie Jewish Christian)?

Buddhists recognise the existence of divine beings. I am sure that many Buddhists do indeed worship them and practice the Buddha Dharma, too. In the spirit of liberality most Buddhists are happy for people to take from the teachings in whatever way they find useful or helpful. The Buddha Dharma is no one’s property and followers of Buddhism are free to believe anything they like.

However, in Pure Land Buddhism it is taught that it is contrary to the Buddha’s teaching to be conflicted in one’s path and it has to be said that there is a lot of scriptural evidence in support of this. It’s also difficult to see why anyone would want to follow another path. If they do not find Buddhism satisfactory why wouldn’t they abandon it altogether and not waste their time? On the other hand, if, as for me, it is a source of immense, profound joy, gratitude and salvation, why would they want to look elsewhere?

#### Could the Christian “Kingdom of God” be a foretaste of the idea of Nirvana, but partly expressed here on earth?

No. Nirvana is a state of total freedom and transcends all realms of form.

#### Why does Buddhism seem to deny and destroy our individual personalities?

Buddhism does not in any way deny our personalities. But it does see them as complex — inherently deluded and under thrall of greed and anger. When these ‘defilements’ are cleared away the pure light of Buddha-nature (*buddha-ta*) appears.

#### Can our personalities be also positive?

All beings have Buddha-nature. Every being has the potential to become enlightened and a Buddha.

#### Where does the love between human beings fit into Buddhism?

It depends what you mean by love. It can be associated with attachment and grasping, and is an aspect of greed. The highest good in the Buddha Dharma is compassion (*karuna*) that is born from realisation of not-self — the perfection of wisdom (*prajnaparamita*). Pure compassion sees all beings exactly as they are and understands them perfectly thus becoming completely free of all discrimination and one with them. In Buddhism true love is that kind of compassion.

#### What place do women have in Buddhism?

Women have Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment. Indeed one of the most popular Buddhas or bodisattvas in the Buddhist world is Kuanyin (*avalokiteshavara*) ‘She Who Hears the Cries of the World.’ There are many sutras where women become enlightened. One of the most popular sutras, *The Lotus of the Wonderful Law*, says that women can become Buddhas.

#### Why do women have more laws to fulfil than men (311 laws compared with 227)?

You are referring to the *pratimoksha*  rules of a document called the  *Vinaya*. It belongs to a different cultural milieu like many religions that were founded millennia ago and the rules reflect the cultural norms of the time. I am not sure how scrupulously it is followed now. The Vinaya was abolished in Japan, where I was ordained, in 822 AD — nearly 1,200 years ago! It was replaced by the Bodhisattva precepts; there are 10 principal and 48 minor precepts. All apply equally to both women and men. The Vinaya remains an object of study.

The school of Dharma that I belong to was established in 1224 AD and we do not discriminate in any way whatever. The precepts no longer include a requirement for celibacy.

#### Is it preferable to be reincarnated as a man or as a woman?

I don’t see why either would make any difference.

#### Can Buddhist monks laugh loudly (rule in the Vinaya)?

I read the *Vinaya* in my 20s and do remember a rule like that. In fact I laughed out loud!

#### Is it true that you cannot be a Buddhist monk if you are not complete in 32 bodily parts?

It could be so but I do not know what the body parts are. I cannot remember. There are no rules of that kind in our school, which has never discriminated on any grounds.
