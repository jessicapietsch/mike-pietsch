## Did Jesus really exist? (Sermon on Palm Sunday 28 March 2021)

Did Jesus really ride into Jerusalem on this day 2000 years ago? And five days later did he really die on the cross at the hands of the Roman soldiers?

Have you ever been questioned as to whether or not Jesus even existed? Or maybe you have been asked as to how reliable the Bible is? Wasn’t the text of the Bible changed around by the monks during the Dark Ages? Didn’t the church just manufacture their ideas over the first few centuries after Jesus had been and gone? To what extent was the memory of Jesus embellished by the first Christians and those after them who had never even seen him? Is there any evidence outside of the Bible that verifies that Jesus existed?

These are just a few of the questions that might have been put to you, or that you yourself have asked about the Christian faith. Today we celebrate Palm Sunday when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey and was received by many people as the Messiah. And later this week we follow Jesus through the whole legal process he underwent before being put to death by the Roman Empire.

How much of this is accurate or true or reliable? **Did Jesus exist?** Did he teach in Jerusalem? Was he put to death?

When we ask these questions, we also have to ask the **counter-question**: ‘What are the requirements for assessing the historicity of Jesus or of any event in the past?’

We also have to ask the very basic question as to whether the other person believes there is truth and whether they accept other historical events in the world as true. Do they accept that the scientists can say that 100 million years ago this particular type of dinosaur was walking the earth? Do they believe that Alexander the Great conquered all of the then-known world in his brief lifetime? Do they believe that the Roman Empire lasted for about 500 years and that Julius Caesar was assassinated?

If they accept these well-known and accepted historical facts, which are agreed on by scholars and the general public, are they aware of the evidence that we use for confirming these events? Equally, do we judge the Biblical accounts and the life of Jesus with similar criteria?

Let’s take for example the person of **Julius Caesar**.

The earliest manuscript that we can go to today that speaks about Julius Caesar was written 950 years after Caesar died. There were manuscripts before this, but they have disappeared.

By comparison, the earliest manuscript of the **New Testament** was written only 100 years after Jesus lived, and we have a portion of John’s Gospel in a manuscript dated 110 AD.

And how many manuscripts referring to Julius Caesar do we possess now? Only ten. By comparison, the number of early manuscripts of the New Testament are 24,000! Historians who research and write about Julius Caesar certainly accept that Julius Caesar existed and they know a great deal about what happened in his life, including his assassination by 50 people. Likewise, historical scholars of the New Testament know that Jesus existed and they can verify that we have very early and accurate information about Jesus. This is well and truly before the Dark Ages or before the church or monks could change the early manuscripts. The documents of the New Testament are second to none in their abundance and closeness to the events they describe. There is a whole historical science that can work out which of the manuscripts are the earliest and which ones are the most accurate, and which ones might have been modified along the way.

But what about **writings outside the New Testament**? Do they give any credibility as to who Jesus was?

There are two main writings, one of which is the **Jewish historian Josephus,** who in the first century mentions Jesus in his ‘ *History of the Jewish people* ’. In the section on Pontius Pilate, Josephus writes about both John the Baptist and Jesus.

About Jesus he specifically wrote:

> ‘Now there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works—-a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. Jesus drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those who loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct to this day.’

So, Josephus wrote specifically about Jesus from within the Jewish nation.

The other author outside of the New Testament who wrote about Jesus was a **Roman historian called Tacitus**. In the early second century he described Nero’s reaction to the early Christians in this way:

> ‘Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.’

There is obviously far more textual evidence for Jesus than for Julius Caesar. This includes the **writings of St Paul** as well as the **four Gospels**.

The four Gospels give us four perspectives on Jesus that give us a three-dimensional collage of this person Jesus. If is like when the family has a large Christmas dinner. If you asked four people who were at the dinner as to what happened you will get four descriptions of the events of the day. They will all be different and highlight certain aspects depending on where they were seated and who they talked with and whether they were interested in the food or the conversations or the activities out in the backyard. They will not include everything, but leave out some things, or see some situations from different angles. But listening to the four of them give their experience of the day will give you a greater picture of what happened.

Likewise, as we enter this last week of Jesus’ ministry. Each of the Gospels devotes a large part of their Gospel to the events of this week and give us a deep and living memory of what happened. They pass on the information of the eyewitnesses who saw it from various angles. They essentially agree about what occurred, but they emphasise or focus on different aspects of what Jesus said and did as well as how the disciples reacted along with the Jewish and Roman authorities. If all that they had given us was one sanitised version constructed by a committee, we would have to be both concerned and all the poorer for seeing Jesus in only a one-dimensional way.

We are so privileged as followers of Jesus that the first disciples gave such an honest picture of Jesus and themselves. They do not whitewash themselves, but describe their actions and weaknesses ‘warts and all’. Most importantly they invite us to not just see Jesus as an historical person who entered Jerusalem but as our humble King who came to die on the cross for the whole world, including every person here today. Jesus’ passion week was not a spiritual high for Jesus, but the ultimate moment when he bit the harsh bullet of God, taking on the evil powers of Satan, physically and spiritually. Jesus won the battle through his love, compassion and willingness to lay his life on the line for you and me. For that there is no better response than “Hosanna! Save us!” In this spirit we move forward into this week.

**Afterthought:**  
So now let’s re-look at Jesus and the implications of his life. It is significant that there is far more evidence for the life of Jesus, because who Jesus is and what he said have far bigger consequences than what Julius Caesar said or did. The concrete reality of Jesus affirms to us that God was not ashamed to take on a human body which was part of his creation. Jesus also personally and physically took on the Roman Empire mounted on the back of a donkey as he entered Jerusalem. This same Empire was then used by the Jewish leaders to get rid of this trouble-maker Jesus who had been pointing his accusatory finger at their selfish and arrogant hearts as they publicly strutted about in their beautifully coloured and cut clothing that set them apart from the plebs (*hoi polloi*).

From the *Annnals* of Tacitus (ca 115 AD):

> “And there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women. But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.
> 
> Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
> 
> Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man’s cruelty, that they were being destroyed.”
