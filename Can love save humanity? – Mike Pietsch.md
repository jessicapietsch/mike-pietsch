This was the question that was put to readers of ‘ **The Guardian Weekly** ’ (Australian edition), an international newspaper based on ‘The Guardian’ which is a daily newspaper in England. The responses came back from people all over the world in the 1st of June edition, 2018. In my opinion, the responses were both profound and well worth thinking about. I leave you to ponder them and see what you think.

## Can love save humanity?

> ‘Probably not…but there will be pleasure along the way’  
> David Turner (Bellevue Heights, South Australia)

> ‘Only in its purest form, applied liberally’  
> Charlie Bamford (David, California, US)

> ‘As I see it, it’s the only human quality that can save us. The golden rule —do unto others as you would have them do unto you—is more necessary now than ever.’  
> Diane Doles (Seattle, Washington, US).

> ‘Not even love can save what doesn’t want to be saved.’  
> R De Braganza, Kilifi, Kenya.

> ‘It won’t be worth saving without it!’  
> David Kettle (Northcote, Victoria Australia).

> ‘Love will have far better odds than hate.’  
> John Benseman (Auckland, New Zealand).

> ‘Without a doubt, but we need practice, and reminders when we’re falling behind.’  
> Richard Orlando (Westmount, Quebec Canada)

> ‘Doubtful. Maybe we only recognise love after experiencing its absence.’  
> Mary Oates (Perth, Western Australia).

> ‘Somewhere along the line humanity was equated with caring, compassion, benevolence and, yes, love. There must have been a reason.’  
> Margaret Wyeth (Victoria, British Columbia Canada)

> ‘It already has.’  
> Sarah Klenbort (Bronte, NSW Australia).
