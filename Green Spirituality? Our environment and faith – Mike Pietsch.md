The **Old Testament** gives us a deep understanding of Hebrew wisdom and the relationship of God to the earth, both in the creation and the ongoing daily provision of every good thing. The **New Testament** also speaks about creation groaning and awaiting its liberation from its bondage to decay (see especially Romans 8:18-25).

We always need to be anticipating new ways in which God might be calling us into different ways of thinking and living. The Lutheran motto *semper reformanda*   (continually reforming) is most pertinent in this respect. This **process of constant change** is also balanced by an exploration of valuing the importance of the long-term perspective. For example, appreciating the value of the Queen of England for British politics, who provides a larger perspective to the fleeting ‘governments-of-the-day’. It within this ‘bigger picture’ that we also discover and appreciate our Christian faith. It gives us a wider and deeper understanding of the world and God’s universe. Some thoughts in this direction are as follows:

It is important to not only focus on the **positives** nor only on the **negatives**. This is so that we do not fall into either the naïve trap of humanistic optimism, or a pessimistic and cynical view of humans which is devoid of hope. We need to maintain a balance of preserving the world, but not frantically seeing it as the be-all and end-all, i.e. literally idolising the world of nature. Rather, respectfully caring for the world, but knowing that it is also in a process of growing, re-creating, changing and dying, both in the short-term and long-term. It is important to hold in tension these two realities: not idolising nature, nor neglecting nature (saying as some Christians do: “I can take what I like now because it is all going to end one day.”)

As Christians we can appreciate that we should not be bound by scientific or social theories or movements (nor theological trends!), but rather view them from ‘one step removed’. With this perspective we realise that whatever is the latest theory is only a theory, and so we can happily step outside that particular mind-set or world view and be gently and humbly critical of the ideas being espoused.

We can also be encouraged to see all life as valuable and sacred because it is God’s world. Even when we use parts of creation for our benefit (e.g. food to eat), we ought to receive these gratefully and respectfully rather than just assuming that they are ours. Seeing all life as sacred means also acknowledging the good and the bad in the world, for there is very little that is clearly only good or only bad, and much of it is grey or ‘in-between’. But we know that God identifies himself with both good and bad, both beauty and death, and he can transform each part of it into a far larger whole.

**Norman Habel** writes in this way:

> This work of God is a ‘deep reconciliation’, a radical healing that reaches into all corners of the cosmos. How? By spectacular conquest? No!
> 
> Peace is made ‘through the blood of the cross’. Peace is affected through the God who suffers on the cross and with creation. Embodied in that piece of Earth called Jesus Christ, God bonds with Earth in the battle against those forces of sin and evil that destroy peace and perpetuate alienation. In Christ, then, Earth too suffers and bears the cross. The land too is crucified with the incarnate God. God thereby liberates Earth.
> 
> The sin that Christ overcomes is not merely the personal wrong of human individuals, but the massive corporate sin and environmental injustice perpetrated against our planet. Christ is the ‘lamb of God’ who not only takes away my sins, but as our liturgy says, ‘the sins of the whole world’. And those sins include our crimes against creation. In short, God incarnate also dies for Earth. Earth and its human inhabitants are one. .

I will **conclude** with one last example of how we need to be reinterpreting the Bible for our 21 <sup>st</sup> century. When God said to Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, the issue was a lack of people. But today, with seven billion people on the earth, it is not a matter of simply re-stating this ‘command’ in an era when the world is bulging with human beings. We are not reading the Word of God in its time and context, and consequently not really listening to the word of God. In the same way, as Jesus replaced the Laws of the Old Testament, so we need to discern what the Bible is saying to us then and now. We abuse the Biblical text by seeing it as immutably written and then the words being valid for every time and context.

And **finally**, our discussion needs to be ongoing, bearing in mind the welfare of the future generations in our hearts. How do we live today, not just for ourselves, but also considering the future generations? Some of the resources of the world are finite and not just for our greed today. In the **Lord’s Prayer** we pray ‘give us this day our daily bread’, not our daily greed. With all of this, however, we trust that with God’s grace, and our goodwill, we can find solutions to provide for everyone so that we can move forward confidently, but also carefully, i.e. full of **care**  but also being  **carefree**.

**A few thoughts**

We are to do this with Christ and in the light of his grace and truth. Students, researchers and teachers are not only to approach their tasks to find out the truth, but when they discover new truths they are to use and apply them with grace, and not just for their own benefits or to manipulate the world in ways that are convenient for them, or for their own power trip or chance to make money or gain academic prestige. We could go on with every area of our lives.

We are not to deify the world as does animism and modern day ‘ *ecomania* ’ which sees the world as all that we have and in a frenetic way that is almost religious calls out to people in desperation to ‘save’.

But neither are we to just use the world for our own selfish and plundering ideas because it will one day come to an end. We are to see it as God’s world which we have been charged with managing and nurturing.
