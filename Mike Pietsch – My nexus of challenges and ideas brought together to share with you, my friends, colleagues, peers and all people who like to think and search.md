- a university chaplain who is there for students and staff in a pastoral manner, but who also loves the cut and thrust of discussion, debate and alternative views
- a person who is yet to be shown a better way of looking at the world and living in it other than through the eyes and heart of Jesus Christ (now there is a challenge I hope you will take up and offer me)
- a work in progress, as is this web site, please contribute in whatever way to its growth through your critical responses, alternative views and constructive criticism
- providing this website as a resource to be used for discussions, sermons, ideas, devotions, or whatever. I just ask that you acknowledge the author (Mike Pietsch) when you use these materials (according to the appropriate copyright laws).

==I dedicate this website to my wife, Helen, and our children and grandchildren, who have shaped me, challenged me and supported me through highs and lows. Their thoughts and ideas are reflected in this website.==

==I also owe a deep sense of gratitude to Jess Pietsch (one of my nieces) who has provided all of the technical and creative ways in which this website is presented.==
