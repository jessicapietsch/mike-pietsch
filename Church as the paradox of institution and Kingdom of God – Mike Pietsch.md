**“How do we live with the paradox of the church being both an institution and the body of Christ? What do we say to people who say: Jesus ‘yes’, church ‘no’?”**

### THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF SEEING THE CHURCH:

- One is from an institutional perspective in which it is a **public body with a constitution**, rules and guidelines, financial responsibilities and all that goes with running any organisation.
- the other is a more laid-back, informal ‘ **body of Christ in the community** ’.

Why do some people see themselves as Christians but do not connect or identify with the public body of the church? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each of these perspectives and practices?

### Responses of the young adults of Calvary Lutheran church

These are the random ideas that were thrown forward by the young adults:

- How did we get from the Biblical view of the church to what it is today?
- What is the relationship between Biblical traditions and church traditions?
- Why doesn’t the church allow women to be ordained?
- How can the church say something is right and something else is wrong?
- Why is the church biased on the issue of gender and homosexuality?
- How should we deal with hypocrisy in the church?
- With so much information available on the web, why can’t we make up our own minds without the church?
- Why does the church keep leaders who have done the wrong thing?
- Why are there so many different denominations?
- Where is the love?
- Do we need the building anymore? Can’t we do it all on the internet?
- Can we have a digital church? Plusses and minuses?

#### A part response:

Without the church we would miss out on community, volunteer work, soup kitchen, op shop, youth groups, schools, overseas welfare aid, Education, no one to easily talk to on a one-to-one basis, hospitals.

#### Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s reflections on the church

Through Bonhoeffer’s experience in the ecumenical movement, he had grown weary and cautious about *only* talking about the ‘new humanity’ or ‘kingdom of God’. He knew it could not only be words spoken at an ecumenical conference (or wherever) which can be spoken with fine rhetoric but with no actual consequence or substance. The intentions need to be made concrete, often in community. This is frequently done in a substantial way through the actions of the institutional church. The life of the church on behalf of Christ ‘for the world’ needs to be made real. This means members of the body of Christ working together (either denominationally, geographically or ecumenically) need to do so both practically and formally if there is to be any substance to the body of Christ on earth. Members of the body of Christ can express informally and personally the reality of the kingdom of God, but there often follows the need to work together by means of the public structures of organisations of the institutional church.

In *SC,* he writes:

> **The concrete assembly thus has a very specific significance of its own. First, it shows that the church is something ‘visible’, a community of human beings consisting of body and soul; it is not a community of common convictions or based on kindred spirits, but a community of love made up of real human beings**.

> **And in *Act and Being* he writes the church ‘is visible concretely; it is the Christian church that hears the preaching and believes it. The word of this community is preaching and sacrament; its action is believing and loving.**

> **It is physical sacraments that Jesus gives to the church. Bonhoeffer writes that: ‘The body of Jesus Christ is “for us” in the strictest sense of the word—on the cross, in the word, in baptism, and in the Lord’s Supper. All bodily community with Jesus Christ rests on this fact.**

> **This concreteness is not just for the individual, but for the community and the world as a whole. He writes that ‘Christ entered history; the church is therefore his presence in history. *The history of the church is the hidden center of world history,* and not the history of one educational institution among others.’**

Bonhoeffer takes this physical nature of the church very seriously when he writes:

We believe in the church not as an ideal that is unattainable or yet to be fulfilled, but as a present reality. Christian thinking, in contrast to all idealist theories of community, considers Christian community to be God’s church-community at every moment in history. And yet within its historical development it never knows a state of fulfilment. It will remain impure as long as there is history, and yet in this concrete form it is nevertheless God’s church-community.

#### (ii) The institutional/ public church

The institutional side of the church will be presented in two sections, the first affirming the institutional church and the second noting its limitations.

**(a) Affirmation of the institutional church**

At a time when all public space was being claimed by the Nazis, Bonhoeffer was even more aware of the importance of the physical ‘living space’ for the institutional church.

He wrote:

> **It holds that the church-community claims a physical space here on earth not only for its worship and order, but also for the daily life of its members. That is why we must now speak of the *living space* \[Lebensraum\] of the visible church-community. Jesus’ community with his disciples was all-encompassing, extending to all areas of life.**

> **He also affirmed the historical and empirical nature of the church writing that ‘this \[the church-community\] takes place always within the historical framework of the empirical church. Thus we believe the means of grace to be effective within the empirical.’**

Bonhoeffer proclaimed the kingdom of God as a concrete reality which God creates in the world through his church. He views as heretical a church which only has a superficial or theoretical concept of the ‘kingdom of God’. But Bonhoeffer does not naively accept that all that happens in the institutional church reflects the new humanity God is creating in Christ. He called the institutional church to task on many occasions. And yet despite this criticism, he knows that the institutional church is the means by which Christ has chosen to reveal himself in the world. He strongly affirmed institutions and authority, both within the state and church and worked within the institution of the church both as a pastor and theologian as well as a university chaplain and the principal of one of its seminaries. He knew that there must be one place in the world that ‘is no longer under the dominion of the world, of sin, or of the law. Within this newly created community, all the laws of this world have lost their binding force.’

Bonhoeffer was not a maverick, but where and when he could he went about things corporately and with due respect to institutional process. Within the process he would ask the hard questions and debate the issues, but he would do so as part of the public community of the institutional church. He saw the institutional church as having been created by God. However, he qualified the way in which it was to operate, writing that ‘ **\[t\]he order of the church-community is of divine origin and character, though it is, of course, intended to serve and not to rule.**’ Equally, ‘he accepted no authority for the Church except that of Christ “living and present in it”.’ In referring to this ‘authority of the church’, he did not see the institutional church as primarily an institution of social justice.

At a Youth Peace Conference that year \[1932\] in Czechoslovakia, Bonhoeffer made this clear:

> **From Christ alone we must know what we should do. But not from him as the preaching prophet of the Sermon on the Mount, but from him as the one who gives us life and forgiveness, as the one who has fulfilled the commandment of God in our place, as the one who brings and promises the new world.**

This anchors the institutional church in a gracious relationship with Jesus, rather than in the programme of social reform based legalistically on such Biblical injunctions as the ‘Sermon on the Mount’.

Bonhoeffer warns of this extremity:

> **Many presumptuous attempts have been undertaken to purify the church…In all these movements we find the attempt to have the Realm of God finally present not only by faith but by sight, no longer veiled within the strange forms of a Christian church, but clearly manifested in the morality and holiness of human beings, and in a perfect solution to all historical and social problems.**

Even though Bonhoeffer affirmed the concrete institutional church, he has a number of reservations about the institutional church *per se* which shall be detailed in the next section.

**(b) Limitations of the institutional church**

Because of his focus on Christ, Bonhoeffer was able to stand back from the institutional church and see its limitations as well as its strengths.

Feil notes that Bonhoeffer’s Christology

> provided him with the basis on which a critique of the church could be made. Bonhoeffer spoke of an impulse within Christian faith that is hostile to the church. The argument he presents is not an argument against the church as such; it is an argument in favour of the church because it speaks of and warns against the inherent danger of the church becoming self-sufficient and providing its own justification.

Bonhoeffer himself expressed this rather bluntly in one of his lectures saying that ‘ **the working class may distinguish between Jesus and his Church; he is not the guilty party. Jesus, yes; Church, no!**’

In the same way as Bonhoeffer could be openly critical of the institutional church, so also the university community of staff and students has a role to offer salutary criticism of the church where and when appropriate. If the accusations are accurate, the institutional church needs to admit its faults responsibly and repentantly. The chaplain has a role to play here in directing the criticism of the university to the appropriate parts of the church and ensuring that an adequate response is given by the church in both word and action.

Feil also describes how Bonhoeffer saw that the primary task was not to walk away from the institutional church, but to remain part of it, reforming it from the inside. He notes:

Before the Church Struggle broke out Bonhoeffer had hoped that there would be a **“great reorganization of the churches”**. Believing that the empirical church could not be given up, he attempted with all his strength to reform it.

This attempt at reform did not occur with the Protestant expression of the church in the year of 1933, and so the next step of expressing the church through another church body came in the establishment of the Confessing Church (*Bekennende Kirche).* Bonhoeffer contrasted the Christo-centric church in the public arena with an organisation which may purport to be church, but in fact is only another ‘religion’ and not the body of Christ (such as the German State church under Hitler’s control).

Wüstenberg describes how Bonhoeffer (with his findings in his thesis *SC*) continues this transition and makes the distinction in this way:

> From the year 1935/36 we have Bonhoeffer’s lecture on “The Visible Church in the New Testament”, where he distinguishes between church and religion in the manner of *Sanctorum Communio*: “…it is not a new religion that is established; rather, a piece of the world is created anew, —that is the founding of the church” (330)…This is not even a matter of giving the religious priority over the profane, but of giving God’s actions priority over both the religious and the profane. This is the fundamental difference between the church and a “religious community.”… (330) Religion is thus already understood as something “partial”, while the church encompasses the “totality” of life.

Here we see Bonhoeffer’s criticism of the institutional church which only operates partially rather than holistically. Wüstenberg further writes that,

While the “ **religious community** ” is concerned with “ **dividing life up into religious and secular spheres** ” , the church subscribes to the principle that “ **the entirety of life is requisitioned** ” …

In the *Ethics*, Bonhoeffer picks up this notion again and asserts that the church

> “thus essentially has nothing at all to do with the so-called religious functions of human beings, but rather with the whole person in that person’s existence in the world with all its relationships” (*DBW* 6.84).

So the institutional church needs to be constantly open to scrutiny by both itself and others, watching as to whether it is slipping into a narrow ossified structure that is only there for its own preservation or whether it exists for humanity at large.

However, by the time he writes *Discipleship, Bonhoeffer* is even more aware of the limitations of the institutional church, saying:

> **Here on earth, they only see the opposite of what they are to become. What is visible here is nothing but their dying—their hidden, daily dying to their old self, and their public dying before the world. They are still hidden even from themselves. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. As a visible church-community, their own identity remains completely invisible to them.**

However, right to the very end Bonhoeffer still values the institutional church and in prison sketches out suggestions for its re-creation after the war. The concrete nature of the institutional church is essential, but it will always have its limitations and hiddenness.
