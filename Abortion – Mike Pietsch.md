**Hon David Keith Bernard Basham**

Dear Sir,

Can I please share with you two salient points for your consideration regarding the current abortion bill before the parliament.

**Firstly**, I am a father of three children and a grandfather of four (one of whom is yet to be born). I had the amazing privilege of seeing a video of my fourth grandchild filmed in the uterus of my daughter during a regular check up at the age of 12 weeks. The liveliness and movement of arms, legs and body of that child (barely 6 cm long) in that 20 second video was breath-taking. I have shown the video to countless people, and they all have the same open-mouthed astonished reaction.

**Secondly**, I have recently read statistics about the increase and decrease in abortions under the various recent presidents of the US. When greater emphasis is placed on supportive social welfare, abortions decrease. When the community’s assistance of women and families with babies was decreased, abortions increased.

Abortion of young children in the uterus is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. It is an ethical issue that requires a caring community to address it at every level. Pre-born babies are vulnerable people from a very young time after conception and they deserve all the protection and support that we can give them, along with those who care for them. This includes addressing in particular the needs of their mothers and their supportive families. We cannot walk away from these responsibilities or wipe out the issue through simply legislating a deliberate decision to end their life by means of a medical procedure, executed by medical staff.

When the potential abortion legislation comes before the parliament during these days, I pray that you will represent all of your constituents, those both post-birth and those pre-birth. May you do so compassionately, reflectively and with great awareness of the heaviness of this matter and the lives and community that is at stake now and in the future.

Thank you for representing me and my views in the South Australian parliament.

Yours sincerely,

Michael Pietsch BA BTh Theol
