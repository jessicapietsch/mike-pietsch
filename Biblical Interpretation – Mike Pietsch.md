## Who says MY interpretation is ‘correct’?

### Interpreting the Bible for today

The Church down through the ages has emphasised the humanity and divinity of the Word Jesus Christ. This has also become a method for viewing the Word of God or the Bible. If it is seen paradoxically as 100% human and 100% divine, this leads to a creative way to hear it most fully. It also avoids the problems with either seeing it as primarily (or only) a human document or primarily (or only) a divine document.

The following dialectic (A and B) can be said of these two areas:

**A — B**

100% human **—** 100 % divine

Another important method of reading Scripture is hearing it canonically, or letting Scripture interpret Scripture, rather than getting carried away by individual verses or selected verses.

Use of the Confessions of the church—

Three ecumenical creeds and Lutheran Confessions as well as other commentators down through the last 20 centuries of church history. This is listening to the whole of the Christian community.

Accept the Word of God in the same way as we accept Jesus Christ: 100% human and 100% divine.

The results of emphasising either or the divine or the human are as follows:

Another aid to interpreting the Scriptures is to keep in mind the **Lutheran summary of the Scriptures** which is **Law and Gospel**. The Bible can be seen as focussing on two strong themes: Gospel and Law. The one area (**Gospel**) deals with our relationships with God and each other. This usually occurs in the form of narrative about God’s relationship with his people. The other part is the **laws** (or guidelines) for how we should or have not lived. These two elements of Scripture are not equally important. The primary part is that of the loving relationship that is formed (and reformed again and again) by God with us and we with each other. This is essentially brought about by forgiveness and acceptance of one another even though we have not fulfilled the laws.

No set of laws can give us the answer to every situation that we will encounter, except in a very general sense. That is why Jesus says ‘every teacher of the law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of heaven is like a home owner who takes out new and old things out of his storeroom’ (Matt 13:52). It is not just a matter of the old laws, but of ‘new laws’ or new ways and insights that are to be valued as well as the old. This does not mean that the old are to be rejected. They also have something to offer and various angles and solid principles to consider, but they are not the only way to address new problems and possibilities.

This difficulty of addressing each new situation can be seen in the following way:

How do we determine which is the most loving action? After all, often it is not a matter of choosing between good and evil, but of choosing the better of the two ‘goods’. For to choose one of the good actions might in actual fact be wrong in this particular situation. For example: I have just had a fight with my wife, and rather than trying to sort it out with her, I go and pick up my daughter from a particular event she is at. Picking up my daughter is a very good act, but may be in this situation the better of the two ‘goods’ would have been to have asked my wife to come along with me and pick up our daughter together, and on the way there discuss our particular difficulty. Or consider this other scenario: I have just had a fight with a friend and he asks me to leave him alone. I then proceed to aggravate the situation by following him around offering to help him with this or that thing. Offering to help is normally a good thing to do, but in this situation, maybe I need to give him some space and not pressure him into dealing with the problem when I want him to, under pressure.

These are relatively minor everyday decisions, but there are thousands of them that occur each day. The approach that we make to them will depend on where we are in our ‘automatic pilot’ and what settings we have in place. These will be determined by our understanding of grace and love, as well as our willingness to be a servant to other people and our willingness to be a follower of Jesus as we are led by the Holy Spirit. This will all be affected by our attitude that has been shaped by reading God’s Word.

So we need to be steeped as much as we can be in God’s Word, which not only means reading it, but hearing the many reliable interpretations of it and being open to the Spirit speaking through these.

Bonhoeffer further describes the process in this way:

> **Intelligence, discernment, attentive observation of the given facts, all these now come into lively operation, all will be embraced and pervaded by prayer. Particular experiences will afford correction and warning. Direct inspirations must in no case be heeded or expected, for this could all too easily lead a person to abandoning God.**

### Eden rediscovered

For Bonhoeffer, God in Christ was everything. The basis for his existence was the love of God, God in Jesus, who had loved and chosen him. No longer is there the question of “good and evil”. In the new relationship created by Christ, the decision which is pivotal is God’s overwhelming decision to love me. It is now knowing and living in this new ‘world of love’ that I can seek to live out Christ’s life in me.

In his *Ethics* he says that

> **a person’s own goodness is now concealed from themself. It is not merely that they are no longer obliged to be the judge of their goodness; they must no longer desire to know of it!**
> 
> **It is not what we strive for, but who we strive for and with. Bonhoeffer emphasises that we are totally new people who are re-gaining the garden of Eden. We are re-made human beings as God had originally intended us to be.**

### Insecure and liberated discipleship

This new relationship is totally unpredictable and fluid for we do not know where Christ may lead us. All we know is that we follow Christ, trusting in his loving compassion, viewing the world and other people through his eyes. Yet within each unpredictable moment we have the utter security of being with Christ.

> **The disciple is dragged out of his relative security into a life of absolute insecurity (that is, in truth, into the absolute security and safety of the fellowship of Jesus), from a life which is observable and calculable into a life where everything is unobservable and fortuitous, out of the realms of the finite into the realm of infinite possibilities. Again, it is no universal law. Rather it is the exact opposite of all legality. It is nothing less than bondage to Christ alone, completely breaking through every programme, every ideal, every set of laws. No other significance is possible, since Jesus is the only significance. Besides Jesus nothing has any significance. He alone matters.**

As baptised sisters and brothers of Christ, how then do we live in this new relationship? How do we determine what is the will of God, or how we are made to perceive the will of God? Bonhoeffer says that we are to use all our human faculties including “ **intelligence, discernment, observation of the given facts** ” *,* our own and others experience as well as anticipating possibilities and consequences. This process is pervaded by prayer, although it is not a matter of expecting direct inspirations. God wants us as humans to responsibly use the amazing resources with which he equipped us in his original creation and which he has re-energised in people living for and with Jesus.

Bonhoeffer sees Christ living in us and giving back to us that fresh and intimate relationship which Adam and Eve had with God in the garden of Eden. He thus affirms the physical incarnation of Christ not only occurred in Palestine, but that it occurs even more pervasively in every Christian. The physical Jesus Christ enters the physical Christian.

Bonhoeffer goes on to say that

> **consequently, our self-examination will always consist precisely in our delivering ourselves up entirely to the judgement of Jesus Christ, not computing the reckoning ourselves but committing it to Him of whom we know and acknowledge that He is in ourselves.**

### Am I a type, or am I myself?

This new relationship with Christ allows me to ‘be myself’, to be the unique creation whom God created. And as a unique person Christ calls me to daily create a reality that has never occurred before. Consequently, trying to obey a bundle of personal and social legalisms will only ‘cramp my style’, a style that Jesus wants to express through me for him and for others.

Bonhoeffer says:

> **The Scriptures do not present us with a series of Christian types to be imitated according to choice: they preach to us in every situation the one Jesus Christ. To him alone I must listen. He is everywhere one and the same. To the question—where today do we hear the call of Jesus to discipleship, there is no other answer than this: Hear the Word, receive the sacrament; in it hear himself, and you will hear his call**.

This new relationship is based on love. Bonhoeffer defines love as “ **the transformation of one’s entire existence by God; it means being drawn into the world as it lives and must live before God and in God** ” . It is into this love that our reading and interpretation of the Bible will lead us.
