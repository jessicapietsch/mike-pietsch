Technically and philosophically the existence of God can be neither proved nor disproved. Ultimately it remains a matter of faith for both the theist and the atheist. The atheist must have faith that God does not exist. There are no totally logical arguments for God not existing. Equally, there are no totally logical arguments for God existing. The approach that I take is that arguments can be put for and against God’s existence. The following paper includes some of the arguments used for demonstrating that God’s existence has a high degree of logical and scientific possibility. These are the main arguments:

### 1\. Cosmological (beginning of the universe)

A **basic premise** of science is that every effect has a cause, and it is the role of the scientist to establish this line of cause and effect. The argument made here is that the universe, even if it was created by the ‘big bang’, must have had something or someone who created the big bang, or whatever led up to its occurrence. This first cause is sometimes referred to as ‘the prime mover’, the original cause. It does not make logical sense that there is an infinite series of causes that never have an initial starting point, because we will always be scientifically asking: ‘but what caused that?’. This was for Ockham the main reason for the existence of God.

Another version of this is a **Muslim argument** called the *Kalam* cosmological argument which has been recently revised by William Craig who writes: “Whatever begins to exist has a cause — the universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause.” This is based on the logical premise that ‘out of nothing comes nothing’. The alternative is that we believe that things can just pop into existence, which even the arch-sceptic Hume denied. William Craig goes on to explain the difference between an **actual infinite** (the infinite number of causes which leads up to the present) and a **theoretical infinite** (the infinite number of causes leading into the future, which have not yet happened). An actual infinite is complete and self-contained as no new members can be added to it. But some major logical absurdities arise if this is the case. For example, adding and dividing this ‘infinite’, self-contained group still leaves an infinite answer which defies some of these mathematical laws. Hence Craig argues that there must be a finite number of causes which originated with the Big Bang, which originated with God.

The **Second Law of Thermodynamics** (Law of Entropy) states that theoretically the world should be running down hill, going from order to disorder. This is derived from evidence to show that all life tends to lose its initial power and order and finds the path of least resistance, e.g. a river running downhill rather than uphill, or the sun gradually burning up its energy which it is doing constantly, but gradually diminishingly, giving out and losing its initial store of energy. This implies that originally something (or someone) must have given the amount of energy and order to the world in order for it to begin and function, before it proceeded to run down and diminish.

### 2\. Design of the universe

All things as we know them have a creator, especially complicated items such as those made by human beings, e.g. electronic machinery, large buildings, books, symphonies, etc. They do not just happen, even if given random chances over a very long period of time. But there are much more complicated parts of our world than what humans make, and these, as science continues to show, are the amazing building blocks and genetic designs of nature and especially human beings. Their complexity and breadth is almost beyond our comprehension. And we are only just scratching the surface of our understanding of what makes up a human being. After all, science has been through various paradigms already, such as Newtonian physics, quantum mechanics, etc, and each one seems to reveal an added depth and complexity to our world, which even on the surface is incredibly diverse, beautiful and amazing.

Albert Einstein wrote:

> “I am not an atheist, and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations.”

The following three quotes are also from Einstein:

> “Certain it is that a conviction, akin to a religious feeling, of the rationality or intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order…This firm belief, a belief bound up with deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself to the world of experience, represents my conception of God.”

> “Everyone who is seriously engaged in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.”

> “My religiosity consists of a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.”

Equally, other quantum physics scientists such as Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schroedinger, and Paul Dirac saw direct links between the laws of nature and the Mind of God.

Schroedinger wrote:

> “The scientific picture of the world around me is very deficient. It gives me a lot of factual information, puts all our experiences in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell a word about the sensation of red and blue, bitter and sweet, feelings of delight and sorrow. If knows nothing of beauty and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously.”

Equally Max Planck wrote:

> There can never be any real opposition between religion and science; for the one is the complement of the other.” He also said, “Religion and natural science are fighting a joint battle in an incessant, never relaxing crusade against scepticism and against dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition…\[and therefore\] ‘On to God!’”

### 3\. The Designer seems to be personal

Just as human designers are intelligent and purposeful and expressive in their designs (whether they be a dress designer, a rocket engineer or a composer of music, or whatever) so quite possibly if there is a creator of the universe. They must have an incredible ability to oversee in a logical and creative way the universe and all its complexity and beauty. Additionally, if there is a Creator who created conscious human beings, they must at least also be conscious and aware of other ‘beings’ whom they have created. How could a mechanical, impersonal, robotic ‘first cause’, create humane and self-aware beings such as humans?

### 4\. Moral law within every culture and tribe or people

There seems to be an inherent and conscious awareness of what is morally right or good (and equally what is wrong or evil). Why is this the case? “Everyone knows certain principles. There is no land where murder is virtue and gratitude vice.”

### 5\. Widespread and ever-present belief in a God

**(or gods / supra-terrestrial beings).**

Human beings have in the past and continue today to overwhelmingly believe in a divine being. Why is this? They are even finding parts of the brain that seem to be hardwired with this concept. And there is an increasing number of people who find satisfaction and meaning in life from this believed reality, as evidenced by the growth in a wide variety of faith communities around the world, despite the enlightenment and the scientific worldview that are sometimes used wrongly to challenge the concept of a God.

Many atheists in the 1950s and 1960s anticipated that by the end of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century religion would not exist. By contrast the opposite is the case. The many communist regimes and countries (which had strong atheist agendas) have all but disappeared (except for North Korea). A number of commentators have suggested that the recent public resurgence of hardline atheism (Dawkins and others) is symptomatic of the anxiety of atheists who recognise that their atheist framework has not been taken up, possibly due to its lack of credibility and application to a positive view of life.

**Pascal’s wager or challenge** (as presented by the following matrix)

Pascal believed that on logical grounds we could not know whether God exists or not. And so, using his probability method he constructed the following matrix to demonstrate the possibilities that we have. He did not present it as a means of forcing or arguing people to believe in a divine being, but in order to encourage them to consider the options, one of which includes the more likely and preferable option that God might exist. “If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that God is.” Agnosticism in Pascal’s view is not possible, for we are already embarked in life, living out our choice.

According to decision theory, the only value that matters in the matrix is the + ∞. Any matrix where f 1, f 2 and f 3 are all finite positive or negative numbers, results in (B) as being the only rational decision.

#### Arguments against the existence of God

I think that there are only two serious arguments against God’s existence and they are listed below. If you would like a more detailed paper addressing this issue, please contact me and I will forward it to you. The second argument has some modern arguments against it and so the argument holds less weight. I would welcome other specific arguments that you might able to present against God’s existence.

**1\. The problem of evil**

‘If God is good and all powerful’, why does he allow evil to exist and happen?’ This, however, depends upon assuming that God, who is all powerful, cannot in his power, decide to relinquish part of his power and allow his creation to share in that power and so have the possibility of freewill and therefore be responsible for good and evil decisions and actions, which might include things that God does not accept, yet permits. The next question from this is why does God permit evil. This is more comprehensibly explored in my paper on ‘If God is good, why is there evil?’

**2\. Another argument is Ockham’s razor**

Ockham’s razor argues that the fewer presuppositions and arguments needed to explain a phenomenon, the better. Some argue that the scientific atheistic worldview has a simpler way of understanding the world. But in more recent years this has been called into doubt by a number of scientists and philosophers, including Antony Flew. Because the scientific world is increasingly discovering the phenomenal complexity of the world and universe, the chances of it occurring randomly are becoming more and more remote. Therefore, the scientists have come up with the idea that there must be multiple universes. Amongst these millions of universes there is a chance that maybe only one of them could produce the complex universe in which we live. But to work with the theory that there are millions of other universes in an attempt to explain the chance of there being one very complex universe (ours), requires a complicated explanation for the origin of our universe (namely multiple universes which have never been seen or evidenced, only imagined as possible in the brain and imagination of a scientist). A simpler explanation, it would seem, is not the belief in millions of other universes (for which there is little or any actual evidence), but rather simply the belief in a ‘prime mover’ or creator God who is outside of the universe as we experience it.

### Conclusion

I would like to conclude with a quote from Strobel which I think opens up the discussion about the existence of God in a new way.

‘… atheism requires omniscience (complete knowledge of everything) … atheists say that nothing exists outside the material world, placing them in a God-like position … In reality, this intellectual position is the height of arrogance … Atheism is an attempt to make humans into gods. That, in a way, is the ultimate irony: Atheists, in their denial of God, cannot but replace the truly omniscient God with … themselves!’

And so the discussion will go on …

### Appendix: God versus Science

‘Let me explain the problem science has with religion.’ The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.

‘You’re a Christian, aren’t you, son?’  
‘Yes sir,’ the student says.

‘So you believe in God?’  
‘Absolutely.’

‘Is God good?’  
‘Sure! God’s good.’

‘Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?’  
‘Yes’

‘Are you good or evil?’  
‘The Bible says I’m evil.’

The professor grins knowingly. ‘Aha! The Bible!’  
He considers for a moment.

‘Here’s one for you. Let’s say there’s a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you try?’  
‘Yes sir, I would.’

‘So you’re good …!’  
‘I wouldn’t say that.’

‘But why not say that? You’d help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn’t.’

The student does not answer, so the professor continues.

‘He doesn’t, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Can you answer that one?’

The student remains silent. ‘No, you can’t, can you?’ the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.

‘Let’s start again, young fella. Is God good?’  
‘Er.. yes,’ the student says.

‘Is Satan good?’  
The student doesn’t hesitate on this one. ‘No.’

‘Then where does Satan come from?’  
The student falters. ‘From God’

‘That’s right. God made Satan, didn’t he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?’  
‘Yes, sir..’

‘Evil’s everywhere, isn’t it? And God did make everything, correct?’  
‘Yes’

‘So who created evil?’ The professor continued, ‘If God created everything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according to the principle that our works define who we are, then God is evil.’

Again, the student has no answer.

‘Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?’  
The student squirms on his feet. ‘Yes.’

‘So who created them?’

The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question. ‘Who created them?’ There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized.

‘Tell me,’ he continues onto another student. ‘Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?’  
The student’s voice betrays him and cracks. ‘Yes, professor, I do.’

The old man stops pacing. ‘Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?’  
‘No sir. I’ve never seen Him.’

‘Then tell us if you’ve ever heard your Jesus?’  
‘No, sir, I have not..’

‘Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter?’  
‘No, sir, I’m afraid I haven’t.’

‘Yet you still believe in him?’  
‘Yes’

‘According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn’t exist … What do you say to that, son?’  
‘Nothing,’ the student replies.. ‘I only have my faith.’

‘Yes, faith,’ the professor repeats. ‘And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith.’

The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of His own. ‘Professor, is there such thing as heat?’  
‘Yes.

‘And is there such a thing as cold?’  
‘Yes, son, there’s cold too.’

‘No sir, there isn’t.’

The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.

‘You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, unlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don’t have anything called ‘cold’. We can hit down to 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest -458 degrees. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the total absence of heat. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.’

Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.

‘What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?’  
‘Yes,’ the professor replies without hesitation. ‘What is night if it isn’t darkness?’

‘You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it’s called darkness, isn’t it? That’s the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, darkness isn’t. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you?’

The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester.

‘So what point are you making, young man?’  
‘Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.’

The professor’s face cannot hide his surprise this time.  
‘Flawed? Can you explain how?’

‘You are working on the premise of duality,’ the student explains. ‘You argue that there is life and then there’s death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.’

‘Now tell me, professor: Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?’  
‘If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do.’

‘Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?’  
The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed.

‘Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?’

The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.

‘To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean.’ The student looks around the room.

‘Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor’s brain?’

The class breaks out into laughter.

‘Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor’s brain, felt the professor’s brain, touched or smelt the professor’s brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir.’

‘So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?’

Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. ‘I Guess you’ll have to take them on faith.’

‘Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with life,’ the student continues. ‘Now, sir, is there such a thing as evil?’

Now uncertain, the professor responds, ‘Of course, there is. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man’s inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.’

To this the student replied, ‘Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God’s love present in his heart. It’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.’

The professor sat down.
