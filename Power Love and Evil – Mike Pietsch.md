## Power: Love and Evil in the church and society

Today I am going to address the matter of power in the church and society.

Power sometimes has a negative connotation because so often the power that people have is **primarily used to advantage the powerful**. But power can also be **utilised for the benefit of many people**. Our task will also address the question as to ‘what sort of power?’

I will **explore these two realities of evil and love** and show how important it is to be able to recognise both and deal with them accordingly. I will be using the thoughts of **Wayne Cristaudo** (especially from his book: ‘ *Power, Love and Evil: Contribution to a philosophy of the damaged* ’ (**PLE**).

Additionally I will draw on insights from **Dietrich Bonhoeffer** ’s book ‘Life Together’ (**LT**) which analyses the power of individuals (in groups in particular) and shows how readily they can abuse their power. He also has a profound and basic theological understanding of the church for addressing abuse of power, especially that of powerful individuals.

One of the overarching messages of this paper is that systems (and groups) that set themselves up as solid and hegemonic are in actual fact only human and frail and need to be seen for what they really are. They are not only powerful and potentially despotic in the way they can crush humans and our humanity, but they are also often what Cristaudo calls ‘ **phantasmic** ’, which means they are humanly constructed phantasies designed to put power in the hands of a few and use fear to get their own way, even if they believe that they are benign dictators that are doing it for ‘the common good’. These hegemonic phantasms in a wide variety of contexts believe that they have most, if not all the answers to our collective and individual futures. They need to be named and questioned before their over-arching power becomes evil. Where do whistle blowers, prophets, and non-complying people who ask too many questions fit into all of this?

The presentation is quite theoretical and theological. Therefore it may be helpful to keep in the back of you mind your experiences of the following practical situations:

Nazism, Communism, economic liberalism, materialism, humanism, socialism, law and order, my political party, religious cults, my pastoral ministry, clubs of all sorts (sporting, hobby, artistic, etc) that nurture autocratic regimes, ‘my football team’, charismatic/ powerful religious leaders, peer pressure groups (amongst teenagers, at work and in the work place), dominant father/ mother in a family, my family, even potentially a power hungry Sunday school teacher, paedophile, etc.

### 1\. Simplistic attempts to just look at love and evil:

‘Love’ and ‘evil’ are often posited as totally opposite dimensions at different ends of the spectrum. Sometimes this can be helpful in trying to understand them, but at other times it can give us a limited and naïve view of reality. Some of these are as follows:

Simple dichotomies:

1\. Right and wrong  
2\. The good and the bad  
3\. Love and fear (Leunig)

Michael Leunig expresses this dichotomy in this way (whereby fear (which is a product of evil) can represent evil) :

> Love and fear.
> 
> There are only two feelings. Love and fear.  
> There are only two languages. Love and fear.  
> There are only two activities. Love and fear.  
> There are only two motives, two procedures,  
> two frameworks, two results. Love and fear.  
> Love and fear.

4\. The law versus chaos  
5\. The ‘new programme’ versus the lax and bumbling previous efforts  
6\. The social programme (political and humanitarian) versus the previous regimes pathetic (or ‘certainly-can-be-improved’) efforts.

In all of these things I (we) selectively choose what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ or the (politically) ‘correct’ way to address the problem (evil).

Equally, the responsibility and possibility for changing is done by me (us).

Essentially I (we) am at the centre of the stage and I (we) am in control.

Cristaudo saliently reminds us that ‘within the West each person *hopes* that his or her will shall be blessed. Such a hope, such a prayer is, as \[Rosenzweig\] rightly saw, the old pagan love of fate. Not “Thy will be done,” but “would that my will be divinised”. (PLE, 7)

### 2\. Love and evil can be very hard to distinguish and often live alongside of each other.

> ‘Evil does not ask its minions to call it by its name. On the contrary, it requires that it not be called by its name, that it be called by other far more venerable, more beautiful names.’ (PLE, 77)

> ‘What we often call evil is precisely that which parades as virtue, which contains virtues but virtues which are only for us and our dream—this but not that, not the neighbour that is there but the neighbour that could be, not the bourgeois, not the Jew, not the Arab, not the black, not the white, not the new, not the different, not the old, not the…Ideologies which spawn evil are infinite in their permutations and rationalizations, arresting in the bizarreness of their contradictions (the Japanese, for example, being made honorary Aryans), but they are also identical –and in the most rigid manner – in their ends: the use of might for the cultivation of fear, purposeless suffering dressed up as purposeful and mass death.
> 
> That people force the sacrifice of one generation for a future is indeed a hard truth that results from love often being able to find no other way to release itself from evil’s overwhelming presence in the present than by sacrificing its presence in the present for the future. Yet the paradox is that the condition in which this becomes inevitable, a necessity that moralists can no more stop than storms and lightning, is due to evil’s growth when one ignores the person who is immediately there in favour of the imagined one of the future.
> 
> Common loves, whether love of order/ material goods/ an idea of future/ one’s tribe etc. fuse groups (bands of thieves, as Augustine reminded his readers, as much as members of states). But when that commonality is a wall, it is the opposite of love’s essence which wants to go even further, fuse more and build more. In a remarkable passage Franz Rosenzweig talks of the movement of God’s love…thereby giving us a sense of love at its most powerful: “Revelation tells of no ‘all-loving’ father; God’s love is ever wholly of the moment and to the point at which it is directed, and only in the infinity of time does it reach one point after another, step by step, and inform the All…God always loves only whom and what he loves; but his love is distinguished from al ‘all-love’ only by a Not-yet: apart from what he already loves, God loves everything, only not yet. His love roams the world with an ever-fresh drive. It is always and wholly of today, but all the dead past and future will be devoured in this victorious today. This love is the eternal victory over death. The creation which death crowns and concludes cannot stand up to it; it must submit to it at every instant and thereby in the final analysis also in the sum of the instants, in eternity.”’ (PLE, 75, 76)

An example of how a system becomes more important than the people it is trying to help:

> ‘The case has also been well made by Ivan Illich that it is precisely the perversion of Christian forms that has characterised the West; that is, the West’s sad fate is that it took over the deeds and fruits of Christian conviviality, free acts of love undertaken by extraordinary souls who set up spiritual orders and institutions such as orphanages and hospitals and poor houses for helping their brothers and sisters, and reproduced them mechanically with rules and norms, thereby creating a range of spiritless/ heartless institutions which deform us.’ (PLE, 7,8)

> ‘All social grouping is dependent upon love, and it is not less true of the fascist or terrorist than it is for the cosmopolitan and multiculturalist, no less true for those who adored Hitler or Stalin as for members of the Baha’i faith, or Catholics and Shi’a and Sunni Muslims. The great political monsters of totalitarianism were able to be so evil precisely because they generated so much love, love towards them and love, hope and faith in a future for people which they promised would be heavenly for people just like them. “I cannot distance myself from the love of my people,” said Hitler to crowds of adorers ranging across both genders, all ages, all classes. Likewise, Stalin knew that the key to power lay in being both feared *and* loved (as Machiavelli taught as the most likely way of political success). The less loved a political monster the less he or she can mobilise.’ (PLE, 33)

> ‘In Germany a large part of the reason for the disaster was the spiritual lost-ness that was all too manifest in the backruptcy of its speech. To the theologically attuned, like Bonhoeffer and Moltke, the fact of the Protestant Churches’ past with Hitler was the most conspicuous manifestation of that bankruptcy. Such idolatry was possible because one failed to see what the demonic was and the demonic could be wrapped in the name of the saviour.’ (PLE, 34).

> ‘This is precisely what phantasmic love does—it makes the grotesquely unreal look as if there is no other choice, as if it is the only real.’ (PLE, 32)

> ‘Today in the West, to even list these differences \[between Christianity and Islam\] angers people who are either unaware of the life of Mohammed or wish to downplay such trivialities lest offence be caused. Thus has tolerance itself become a phantasm in the West, a phantasm which disarms its followers against intolerance \[of evil\].’ (PLE, 79)

> ‘…anyone who thinks about what really goes on in the sites of justice will know that while some, perhaps even many, at certain times will try to ensure that justice be done, evil too will still get done. Evil does not need majorities to take effect…those who believe too much in law see evil as a contingency that law can conquer and bring within its fold. The doctrine of original sin, by contrast, shows a much more profound understanding of what we are capable of, even when we make laws and prisons. Even in the deepest hell love can manifest itself; even in the most just kingdom evil can hatch.’ (PLE, 124)

### 3\. The reality of evil

> ‘The truth of St Paul’s claim that “all have sinned” is that it is a constant reminder of our dark capacities. It is not that “they” are evil and “we” are good, it is that we all fall under evil’s grip at any moment. And because evil has its rewards – its delights and joys – the temptation is constant…We can do anything, no matter how terrible, if we believe we can justify it. And our subterranean appetite for blood is constantly seeking a way for consciousness to give it permission to be satiated…Humanity has served one phantasm after another in its search for love, and every object of its love has found itself transformed from an up-building to and enslaving power. The transition from life to death is accompanied by a dogmatism of “either-you-are-for-or-you-are-against-us” thinking. “Either-or” thinking is always (the d)evil’s moment of inevitable triumph, for the triumph is in the antagonism, in the necessity of negation, which does not mean that there are not clusters of forces that are ensconced within traditions which are pernicious and need to be called by their proper names.’ (PLE, 86)

> ‘…all societies are somewhat damaged; all societies produce their damned; damnation is often not the choice of the damned – the damned are frequently the sacrifice of previous generations’ inability to see the world they have been making. Some societies at some times are so damaged that all its members are in hell.’ (PLE, 100)

> ‘The scream \[of Edvard Munch\] is the horrific recognition of the terror of life, that there is nothing to shield us from the terror. Behind this scream is the widespread anxiety that we are unloved, that there is no love that can reach us.’ (PLE, 8)

> ‘Initially only few see evil in its earliest phase, just as only few see the full-blown phantasm as phantasm. The first enemies of a phantasm are widely hated and often killed because people live under its rule. ’ (PLE, 47)

> ‘…just as it takes many lifetimes…to make even moderately good parents and children, it took many lifetimes to make Gary’s parents and hence to make Gary \[Gilmore\]. This hard truth of the life-forming processes is one that the ancients and tribal peoples took very seriously. But we moderns do not wish to entertain such a possibility, lest it interfere with the accelerated modern rhythms of social and economic reproduction and our moral, judicial, and political faith in individual sovereignty.’ (PLE, 60)

4\. Jealousy between the Phantasms and God

The problem is not ‘love’ nor ‘evil’ per se, but rather the issue: ‘to whom’ is our love and attention and life directed? Is it towards ‘my scheme’ or a ‘Messianic Saviour figure’ or ‘the ideal social programme’ or ‘the ultimate and most loving spiritual community’? Or is my life directed toward God and his will for my life and the world? The jealousy occurs between love directed towards goals other than God and in turn God’s guarded jealousy to make sure that he is the only one at the centre. Without him being there he knows that things will get seriously out of kilter as we continue to place at the centre the creature (my plans, my social scheme, *mein Fuhrer*, or my family) rather than the Creator.

> ‘Each phantasm strives to be God, and each is, in polytheistic terms, a god….yet, always, the other gods become jealous, and their neglect is at our peril. Gods demand to be worshipped, lest they die and take (parts of) us with them. Like us, they seek immortality and that can only be attained through our sacrifice.’ (PLE, 49)

> ‘Western men and women have long since turned the commandment telling that God is a jealous God into a phantasm and thence have been deaf to the truth of that commandment. The sign of God is precisely the sign that is meant to point to that which is real creative love and which is not phantasmic. …For phantasms are absolutely jealous— so jealous that they will have fathers kill their children, children renounce their parents, brothers and sisters kill each other, civil wars, religious wars, death camps….Phantasms are by nature schismatic, brutal, and murderous. And they provide an endless source of justification for the hell they perpetuate. Yet nothing is more “moral” and law abiding than a phantasm—phantasms provide moral justification for cruelty and murder. The phantasm is the “moral” and legal voice of the lost….And the lost are the well-respected sleepwalking citizens dutifully building the scaffolds of the next hell, which they think is peace and security.’ (PLE, 48, 49)

> ‘What is marvellous is simply the love of the world and the future that stands up in the midst of what is trying to extinguish von Moltke’s capacity to love. This is what was really at stake in the execution of a man like that – the opposition between loves, between one who saw the sacrificial nature of love as divine, and who willingly went under for that, and those poor souls serving a phantasmic beloved who could only deliver mass death, who could only promise a world worthy of life by killing….Hitler was undoubtedly loved, but the love for Hitler was inseparable for the need to hate another…. “In one of his tirades Freisler said to me \[von Moltke\]: ‘Only in one respect are we and Christians alike: we demand the whole man!”’ (PLE, 30)

> Communism and Nazism were *the* secular religious movements of the twentieth century and the cult of the personality but the expression of the idolatrous expressions of those movements.’ (PLE, 34).

> ‘While the National Socialists undertook all the murder and torture under the name of, and in the love for, Adolph Hitler, those like Bonhoeffer, von Moltke, Hillesum, the Scholls and others all sought a name more inclusive. The traditional name for that inclusiveness was God.’ (PLE, 34)

> ‘Without love there can be no evil. This is why Augustine called evil a privative, a nothing. It needs something good to destroy, whether that is innocence, beauty or someone’s possessions. Ultimately it is love itself that evil seeks to negate through the substitutions of the love that ultimately leads to the nothing.’(PLE, 45)

At a political level, Cristaudo sees this as the response to the worship of the phantasmic order.

> ‘The paradox at work here hangs on the truth of love’s ultimate demand. It is a refusal to participate in the phantasmic (dis)order. The fanatic is convinced that if this or that group is expunged then the world will be right; it will be free of evil…Those who are the sacrifice make of their life a gift to the future. Their refusal to feed the energy acts as a kind of conductor, relaying evil outside of the world. In time those sacrificial acts may be remembered and become essential for the next generation’s integrity, enabling it to know that it is not just the spawn of evil.’ (PLE, 43)

> ‘…the search for universal justice must lead to mass murder because human beings, once deluded that they possess the status of a god-man, are boundless in appetites and will have no brake on them. The moralistic appeal to universal humanity and subsequent ease with which a humanistic goal can justify mass murder to reach its end is one of the most luciferic aspects of modernity. God’s power, by definition, cannot be harmed by humans, and hence those who would destroy him can only destroy an idea of him.’ (PLE, 41)

> ‘Evil is the (crowd of) phantasm(s) that thrives on our love at our and the world’s expense. It is the inadequate love that parades itself as adequate, the lie that gives itself as truth—the spectre of our love’s inadequacy and our unworthiness to live in the love that can be dreamt of, but which is rarely realised.’ (PLE, 45)

> ‘..to ignore the one who is the neighbour is to break the whole chain of potencies which can enliven our world and ourselves. When a neighbour is marked as a mere ‘it’ to be eradicated, the obstacle to the reign of the triumphant good, the eradicators are creating their own future hells — and even if they do not grasp this, their children and grandchildren will have to face the consequences and bear the shame of the wretchedness that their forebears have created.’ (PLE, 77)

### 5\. God and love at the centre of our lives and world.

> “Jesus’ religion of love was the exact psychological counterpoint to the politics of power. Jesus pointed humanity to the truth that where force rules there is no love, and where love reigns force does not count.” Carl Jung

The solution is to have God at the centre in everything, and we find this best when we see Christ incarnated into the centre of every relationship and decision that we make. This means that we do not live according to our laws, our plans and schemes, or our latest ‘saviour/ messiah’, but we follow Christ and the Holy Spirit as we live totally in his gracious care and direction.

This then has implications for us in our personal and communal relationships. No longer do we trust anyone else, not even ourself. We acknowledge that all people and parts of creation have their limitations and faults. We place ourselves and our wills into the service of others and the wider community, shaping and interacting with the community not so that it takes on the shape that we want it to, but in the same way as Christ embraces every individual in the community, warts and all. But there are still some partial solutions to the reality of evil which sometimes act as though they are the primary response to evil. These are intellect (education) and legislation. Both of these have been found wanting.

#### (i) Not primarily by intellect and education

> ‘Dante saw that the pagan concept of the intellect was fundamentally deficient in its failure to appreciate that the virtues of the intellect are incomplete if not conjoined with the forces of faith, hope and love. These forces cannot simply be grasped by the intellect’s self-probity. In this schema, then, it is not the intellect as such which is *sui generis* \[of its own kind, unique\]. It is love that lights the intellect, just as it is the intellect that illumines the lovable. The intellect thus is only really what it is when it is luminous, when it is up-building, and when it works with and for love, which itself is carried further by the invisible powers of hope and faith. It is this recognition of faith’s power that led Hildegard of Bingen to say that the visible powers are the weak powers, the invisible ones the strong ones.’ (PLE, 113)

> ‘That is why intelligence as such is never the primary drive itself, but always in service to some higher power. Plato thought of it as the good or the appearance of the good; but the dualist traditions of the divine and the demonic I think most powerfully express the truth of the ease with which the intellect becomes corrupted, becomes inadequate for helping us flourish in the world that we have made.’ (PLE, 86)

#### (ii) Not primarily by justice

> ‘But love is a greater power than justice. For it is love in its most demanding form – sacrifice – which is necessary for justice to be born. And justice cannot sustain itself indefinitely if it is not fed by love. The grave danger of making justice the predominant power of social life is that in its pursuit we continue to build a loveless, anodyne \[mentally soothing\] and anonymous world which becomes ever more legally bound. For justice is realized only in law.
> 
> But law, when it is merely human law, has no connection with the love we hunger after, but rather it is the compromise and curtailment of this range of desires/ behaviours for that which is always elusive and which love seeks. To be idolatrous towards evil distracts us from seeing the evil that is generated and that does not fall into justice’s net – the evil of extra-legal manipulations and deceits and emotional abuses and their kin.
> 
> For Jews and Muslims for whom God’s law and God’s love is one, justice is close to Godliness. But the political culture of modern secular societies inherits the dualisms that were generated in the Christian world, not the least of which is the separation between human and divine law as irreconcilable legislative spheres. To be sure, the great Christian teachers of natural law, such as Aquinas, saw that human law should conform as much as possible to natural law (natural law being the law of the reason that we have as natural beings and which is granted to us by God). But the Christian mistrust of worldly powers alerts us to the realization that God’s love and God’s justice will never find complete expression within any regime.
> 
> While there is no shortage of secular rulers who would have their citizens believe that they can provide all that is necessary for the good life, secular regimes do not need to reconcile the justice they provide with God’s love. And where liberal democratic regimes have emerged, in spite of the propaganda of the particular legislators occupying office, there has been a general acceptance of the limits of justice. That is, most people know that justice will not deliver us our highest goods, just as it will not deliver us from evil; justice only ever delivers some people from some evils. Justice is a moment in the moment of evil – it is a reactive force. Matters are not helped by the modern concept of justice, as opposed to the more classical and nuanced understandings offered by Plato and Aristotle, being so focused upon the idea of equality. Equality is a late addition to justice. It is a very long way from its origin, which is revenge. Injustice is an infliction, a deprivation of part of one’s life, whether in the form of body or property. Justice is originally the reaction to this infliction…It is not, in its inception, impartial or disinterested. It is as remote from being a philosophical idea as a child is from being an adult. (PLE, 117, 118)

In conclusion and leading on to the next section:

> ‘Love is a greater power than justice because it is a more creative power, but also because, as Emmanuel Levinas says, “Justice comes from love…Love must always watch over justice.” But \[love\] is a much harder power to fathom than justice, because it is not an abstraction…Love as a flowing force is not, nor can ever be, an idea. Justice, on the other hand, easily slips into being an idea as soon as law is detached from love – and God is the only sign we know that is capable of completely harmonizing love, law and justice, though even \[God’s\] history suggests his justice and love easily fall into tension with each other.’ (PLE, 122,123)

> ‘Good lawmaking in a just society tries to limit the future wrong; the belief that we can have a society where there will be no future wrong is to misunderstand the power of justice and the power of evil. It is a religious faith. The realization of heaven on earth will not be the triumph of justice, but the dissolution of law and justice all together. Is this possible? All evidence suggests not. But we are the species who continually renders the impossible possible. But that rendering, to repeat, will not be realized primarily through justice. Justice is too narrow a conduit to transport all the energies we need for such a large task.’ (PLE, 124, 125)

#### (iii) But by love.

More specifically: by the love of God in Christ, who is both in us and in between us, creating genuine community.

> ‘How foolish and palpably absurd it would have seemed to a Roman if he had been told that it was not the emperor, nor the richest and most politically powerful men in Rome who were really the most powerful men in the Empire, but a small group of uneducated Jews living on the perimeter of the Empire. How much more absurd would it have seemed had the same Roman heard that these Jews believed in a nobody who died a criminal’s death and that he was the Son of David, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and that from him would spring inspirations and ideas and acts which would help bring down the Empire and form a new world. Eventually kings and emperors would bow down before images of this man as a baby and dying on the cross. This faith of the men and women generated more reality than the power that was already there; their absurd faith was far more real than the solid sensible acts of acceptance of the visibly existing powers of the day. No amount of understanding how power is presently formed, produced and distributed can help us predict what can be achieved by acts of love. On the other hand, we know that the worst powers of the world love to fill the void left by love’s absence.’ (PLE, 10, 11)

> ‘There is no greater expression of the meaning of love’s potency than the idea that God is himself redeemed, that God himself is open to the entreaties of humanity’s love for redemption, that he is transformed and becomes more than he is. This extension of the essence is the key to the meaning of spirit. Spirit moves and is not restricted by essence, it is alive into the infinite and infinitely alive in its ability to charge and activate the finite. This idea of the infinite and loving God and God’s infinite love…is the real difference between looking at life that is prepared to be open to all its powers and a way that seeks to shrink the spirit within the confines of a mind and heart closed to the possibilities of love. Indeed we can estimate the closed-ness of a human heart by its certitude of the closed-ness it ascribes to God’s vision and by its inflexibility in the face of the wave of possibilities and openings to love’s generosity (or grace, in more theological language). What powers, then, we attend to are ultimately the powers we are willing to respond to, to be sustained by and also to sustain through our faith; our faith is reflected back to us in the world that we have made that in turn makes us.’ (PLE, 102)

We all come with various ideals and expectations into community – into a congregation – into a small group, into a worship situation, into the church — Bonhoeffer has some very pertinent things to say about this.

May I quote extensively from Bonhoeffer some of his insights, which I could not put better:

> The fact that we are brothers and sisters only through Jesus Christ is of immeasureable significance. Therefore, the other who comes face to face with me, earnestly and devoutly seeking community is not the brother or sister with whom I am to relate in the community. My brother or sister is instead that other person who has been redeemed by Christ, absolved from sin, and called to faith and eternal life. What persons are in themselves as Christians, in their inwardness and piety, cannot constitute the basis of our community, which is determined by what those persons are in terms of Christ. Our community consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us. That not only is the true beginning, as if in the course of time something else were to be added to our community, but also remains so for all the future and into eternity. I have community with others and will continue to have it only through Jesus Christ. The more genuine and the deeper our community becomes, the more everything else between us will recede, and the more clearly and purely will Jesus Christ and his work become the one and only thing that is alive between us. We have one another only through Christ, but through Christ we really do *have* one another. We have one another completely and for all eternity.
> 
> This dismisses at the outset every unhappy desire for something more. Those who want more than what Christ has established between us do not want Christian community. They are looking for some extraordinary experiences of community that were denied them elsewhere. Such people are bringing confused and tainted desires into the Christian community. Precisely at this point Christian community is most often threatened from the very outset by the greatest danger, the danger of internal poisoning, the danger of confusing Christian community with some wishful image of pious community, the danger of blending the devout heart’s natural desire for community with the spiritual reality of Christian community. It is essential for Christian community that two things become clear right from the beginning. *First, Christian community is not an ideal, but a divine reality; second, Christian community is a spiritual and not a psychological reality.”*
> 
> On innumerable occasions a whole Christian community has been shattered because it has lived on the basis of a wishful image \[ie a phantasm\]. Certainly serious Christians who are put in a community for the first time will often bring with them a very definite image of what Christian community life should be, and they will be anxious to realize it. But God’s grace quickly frustrates all such dreams \[a smashed phantasm\]. A great disillusionment with others, with Christians in general, and, if we are fortunate, with ourselves, is bound to overwhelm us as surely as God desires to lead us to an understanding of genuine Christian community. By sheer grace God will not permit us to live in a dream world even for a few weeks and to abandon ourselves to those blissful experiences and exalted moods that sweep over us like a wave of rapture. For God is not a God of emotionalism, but the God of truth. Only that community which enters into the experience of the great disillusionment with all its unpleasant and evil appearances begins to be what it should be in God’s sight, begins to grasp in faith the promise that is given to it. The sooner this moment of disillusionment comes over the individual and the community, the better for both. However, a community that cannot bear and cannot survive such disillusionment, clinging instead to its idealized image, when that should be done away with, loses at the same time the promise of a durable Christian community. Sooner or later it is bound to collapse. Every human idealized image that is brought into the Christian community is a hindrance to genuine community and must be broken up so that genuine community can survive. Those who love their dream of a Christian community more than the Christian community itself become destroyers of that Christian community even though their personal intentions may be ever so honest, earnest and sacrificial.’ (Life Together, 34-36)

The Christian community should be the most annoying and hardest community to live in. If Christ through grace welcomes all into the church – it will be the hardest place in all the world to live — everybody will be there including those with their annoying habits, those with personal agendas, those with distracting physical imperfections. Then there will be those with bent personalities due to growing up in dysfunctional families, not to mention those with long-term illnesses, those who are desperately needing love and attention. Into this cauldron of humanity there will also be the political animals as well as those with warped philosophies of life they have picked up along the way.

How can we live, let alone love in this community? Can we even call it community? We may not – but Christ calls it his community – into which we are all invited, and into which we will discover it is the greatest privilege in which to live, because forgiveness and acceptance are at the centre of it.

Bonhoeffer goes on to say:

> ‘God hates this wishful dreaming because it makes the dreamer proud and pretentious. Those who dream of this idealized community demand that it be fulfilled by God, by others, and by themselves. They enter the community of Christians with their demands, set up their own law, and judge one another and even God accordingly. They stand adamant, a living reproach to all others in the circle of the community. They act as if they have to create the Christian community, as if their visionary ideal binds the people together. Whatever does not go their way, they call a failure. When their idealized image is shattered, they see the community breaking into pieces. So they first become accusers of God, and finally the desperate accusers of themselves. Because God already has laid the only foundation of our community, because God has united us in one body with the other Christians in Jesus Christ long before we entered into common life with them, we enter into that life together with other Christians, not as those who make demands, but as those who thankfully receive. We thank God for what God has done for us. We thank God for giving us other Christians who live by God’s call, forgiveness and promise. We do not complain about what God does not give us; rather we are thankful for what God does give us daily.’ (Life Together, 36)

These warnings do not mean that as individuals and congregations we should not dream and plan – but it warns us about making our dreams into idols, and it does not allow God to work in ways that are different to what we expect.

It is also a warning about not respecting and recognising that there are people whom we might hurt and walk over in our keeness to “follow the dream, the programme or whatever”.

There is also a warning for pastors:

> This also applies in a special way to the complaints often heard from pastors and zealous parishioners about their congregations. Pastors should not complain about their congregation, certainly never to other people, but also not to God. Congregations have not been entrusted to them in order that they should become accusers of their congregations before God and their fellow human beings. When pastors lose faith in a Christian community in which they have been placed and begin to make accusations against it, they had better examine themselves first to see whether the underlying problem is not their own idealized image, which should be shattered by God. And if they find that to be true, let them thank God for leading them into this predicament. But if they find that it is not true, let them nevertheless guard against ever becoming an accuser of those whom God has gathered together. Instead, let them accuse themselves of their unbelief, let them ask for an understanding of their own failure and their particular sin, and pray that they may not wrong other Christians. Let such pastors, recognizing their own guilt, make intercession for those charged to their care. Let them do what they have been instructed to do and thank God…Just as Christians should not be constantly feeling the pulse of their spiritual life, so too the Christian community has not been given to us by God for us to be continually taking its temperature. The more thankfully we receive what is given to us, the more assuredly and consistently will community increase and grow from day to day as God pleases.

> Christian community is not an ideal we have to realize, but rather a reality created by God in Christ in which we may participate. The more clearly we learn to recognize that the ground and strength and promise of all our community is in Jesus Christ alone, the more calmly we will learn to think about our community and pray and hope for it. Because Christian community is founded solely on Jesus Christ, it is a spiritual community and not a psychological reality. In this respect it differs absolutely from all other communities.’ (Life Together, 37, 38)

Bonhoeffer then extensively contrasts the relationship between people with and without Christ at the centre:

> ‘Because Christian community is found solely on Jesus Christ, it is a spiritual community and not a psychological reality. In this respect it differs from all other communities. The Scriptures call pneumatic or “spiritual” what is created only by the Holy Spirit, who puts Jesus Christ into our hearts as lord and saviour. The scriptures call psychological or emotional what comes from the natural urges, strengths, and abilities of the human soul. The basis of all pneumatic, or spiritual, reality is the clear, manifest Word of God in Jesus Christ. At the foundation of all psychological, or emotional, reality are the dark, impenetrable urges and desires of the human soul. The basis of spiritual community is truth; the basis of emotional community is desire. The essence of spiritual community is light…The essence of emotional, self-centered community is darkness, “for it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come” (Mark 7:21). It is the deep night that spreads over the sources of all human activity, over even all noble and devout impulses. Spiritual community is the community of those who are called by Christ; emotional community is the community of pious souls. The bright love of Christian service, *agape*, lives in the spiritual community; the dark love of pious-impious urges, *eros*, burns in the self-centred community. In the former, there is ordered, Christian service; in the latter, disordered desire for pleasure. In the former, there is humble submission of Christians to one another; in the latter, humble yet haughty subjection of other Christians to one’s own desires. In the spiritual community the Word of God alone rules; in the emotional, self-centred community the individual who is equipped with exceptional powers, experience, and magical, suggestive abilities rules along with the Word. In the one, God’s Word alone is binding; in the other, besides the Word, human beings bind others to themselves. In the one, all power, honour, and rule are surrendered to the Holy Spirit; in the other, power and personal spheres of influence are sought and cultivated. So far as these are devout people, they certainly seek this power with the intention of serving the highest and the best. But in reality they end up dethroning the Holy Spirit and banishing it to the realm of unreal remoteness; only what is self-centred remains real here. Thus, in the spiritual community the spirit rules; in the emotional community psychological techniques and methods. In the former, unsophisticated, nonpsychological, unmethodical, helping love is offered to one another; in the latter, psychological analysis and design. In the former, service to one another is simple and humble; in the latter, it is to strangers treated in us searching, calculating fashion.
> 
> Perhaps the contrast between spiritual and emotional, self-centred reality can be made most clear in the following observation. Within the spiritual community there is never, in any way whatsoever, an “immediate” relationship of one to another. However, in the self-centred community there exists a profound, elemental emotional desire for community, for immediate contact with other human souls, just as in the flesh there is a yearning for immediate union with other flesh. This desire of the human soul seeks the complete intimate fusion of I and You, whether this occurs in the union of love or – what from this self-centred perspective is after all the same thing – in forcing the other into one’s own sphere of power and influence. Here is where self-centred, strong persons enjoy life to the full, securing for themselves the admiration, the love, or the fear of the weak. Here human bonds, suggestive influences, and dependencies are everything. Moreover, everything that is originally and solely characteristic of the community mediated through Christ reappears in the nonmediated community of souls in a distorted form.
> 
> There is, likewise, such a thing as “emotional” conversion. It has all the appearances of genuine conversion and occurs wherever the superior power of one person is consciously or unconsciously misused to shake to the roots and draw into its spell an individual or a whole community. Here one soul has had an immediate effect on another. The result is that the weak individual has been overcome by the strong; the resistance of the weaker individual has broken down under the influence of the other person…
> 
> Self-centred love loves the other for the sake of itself; spiritual love loves the other for the sake of Christ. That is why self-centred love seeks direct contact with the other person. It loves them, not as free persons, but as those whom it binds to itself. It wants to do everything it can to win and conquer; it puts pressure on the other person. It desires to be irresistible, to dominate. Self-centred love does not think much of truth. It makes the truth relative, since nothing, not even the truth, must come between it and the person loved. Emotional, self-centred love desires other persons, their company. It wants them to return its love, but it does not serve them. On the contrary, it continues to desire even when it seems to be serving.’ (LT, 38-42)

> “I must release others from all my attempts to control, coerce, and dominate them with my love. In their freedom from me, other persons want to be loved for who they are, as those for whom Christ became a human being, died, and rose again, as those for whom Christ won the forgiveness of sins and prepared eternal life. Because Christ has long since acted decisively for other Christians before I could begin to act, I must allow them the freedom to be Christ’s. This is the meaning of the claim that we can encounter others only through the mediation of Christ. Self-centred love constructs its own image of the other persons, about what they are and what they should become. (Life Together, 44)

We are called to love as expounded by Paul in I Cor 13, called to be free, and called to serve one another humbly as disciples and servants of Christ. Our humble God calls us to be honest about our weaknesses and follow him, looking to him for strength, Spirit and motivation.

The earliest sign left to us that human beings recognized that love was the circuit breaker of a world doomed to perpetual cycles of hell, is in the Biblical idea of God providing the sacrifice for Abraham. The God of the Israelites is defined by him not demanding that humans (Isaac) be sacrificed.

> ‘The non-believer \[in the phantasm\] is viewed with a mixture of laughter and scoffs, total incredulity and then rage, before the minions will imprison and/or kill someone who speaks the truth. The end of a phantasm means the end of a world. But phantasms run their course: they are overthrown by love and other phantasms.’ (PLE, 48)

> ‘the fate of one who challenges a phantasm at its zenith, is almost invariably, death. The only consolation for the martyr is that his or her death will contribute to the death of the phantasm that has devoured him or her. But a phantasm cannot be killed by violence.’ (PLE, 49)

> ‘There is a dialogical component that is essential to the intellect’s proper function because to address evil means to address not only oneself but also another. That is essential because evil always spreads through indifference, denial, folly or sheer negation. On the other hand, genuine communion does not mean being silent about evils the neighbour is generating when they are generating them, nor is it being defensive when the neighbour notes one’s own contribution to the world’s evil. It is to be in the hard place of the common acceptance of our deficiencies.’ (PLE, 87)

#### (iv) Love is a free S/spirit:

> ‘Love is a spirit whose form must ever keep changing shape so that it can be. Its presence seems perpetual its manifestness continues to break through the chambers of hell that we continually create on earth.’ (PLE, )

This is ultimately the difference between the fruits of morality and that of love. As Jacques Ellul writes in *The Subversion of Christianity*:

> “Revelation is an attack on all morality, as is wonderfully shown by the parables of the kingdom of heaven, that of the prodigal son, that of the talents, that of the eleventh-hour labourers, that of the unfaithful steward, and many others. In all the parables the person who serves as an example has not lived a moral life. The one who is rejected is the one who has lived a moral life. Naturally this does not mean that we are counselled to become robbers, murderers, adulterers, etc. On the contrary, the behaviours to which we are summoned surpasses morality, all morality, which is shown to be an obstacle to encounter with God.
> 
> Love obeys no morality and gives birth to know reality. None of the great categories of revealed truth is relative to morality or can give birth to it; freedom, truth, light, Word, and holiness do not belong at all to the order of morality. What they evoke is a mode of *being*, a model of life that is very free, that involves constant risks, that is constantly renewed.” (PLE, 126)

Conclude with a reading of Psalm 146 or Ezekiel 34:11-24, especially 34: 16-21.

### Questions:

- What abuses of power have you seen in the church?
- How should the church handle pastors and lay-people who take advantage of the power positions that they have?
- What should the church and society do for people who are and who have been crushed?
- Is there any place for aggressive or strong-arm tactics in the church, especially if it is to rescue a person or group of people from a greater evil?
- What role should the church and Christians play in addressing the abuse of power in the community? Don’t we have enough problems of our own? Should not we get our own house in order before we attempt to address power abuse in the community?
