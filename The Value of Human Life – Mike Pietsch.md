(6 December 2020 | Advent 2)

The challenging topic for this *Reach* service is ‘What is the value of human life? We will be looking at this through the lenses of abortion and euthanasia, both of which speak of death.

These issues are both hot topics around the world at the moment and in South Australia. The ‘ **Termination of Pregnancy Bill** ’ is currently being debated in our South Australian parliament, and in Poland there are mass protests on the street about the government winding back the possibility of abortion after it had been liberalized some years ago.

At the other end of the spectrum is the international debate about balancing the deaths of our elderly citizens by **Covid-19** with the economy and the greater need of the future generations. Both of these discussions have behind them the question of the value of a human life, which is looking at it from a life perspective rather than one of death.

How do we put a value on human life? Is every human being equally important and valued?

The wage of a person who works in Hungry Jacks might only be $18 per hour whereas a surgeon might get $200 plus per hour. Does that mean that the surgeon is worth more than the person who flips burgers? To the family of the burger flipper, their son or daughter is priceless compared to the surgeon who is not worth anything in particular to the burger flipper’s family.

How do we measure the value of a person? “Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulphur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium.” There are a few other ‘trace’ elements, but if you had to buy all of these items, they would not cost you very much. This is one way of measuring the value of a human person.

There is a philosophy called **materialism** which does not see the human being as much more than these material elements. How sad and empty is this view of people. I think it says more about the one-dimensional person believing it rather than about the actual value of humans themselves.

By contrast with this one-dimensional view is the **passionate view point** of people about the issues of abortion and euthanasia. This is true for both sides of the argument. The issues in themselves create a massive amount of anger, pain, frustration, passion and conflict. The problem with both of the issues of abortion and euthanasia is that they create a great deal of polarity and uncontrolled passion. They are such emotional issues, because they are about life and death. But there is a danger that the emotions on either side should dominate the discussion. These are extremely complex human matters and involve a great need for listening to all sides of the discussion within a wider social context.

For example, with abortion clinics, is it right to be publicly shaming and calling into question the decisions of these women / couples as they are walking into an abortion clinic, possibly after much personal agony before a ‘last solution’ is regretfully made? Wouldn’t it be far better to be working alongside these women and couples, helping them to cope with the emotional and physical problems that might be encouraging them to make this decision?

It may well be the lack of family, emotional and financial support that has led them the parents to the conclusion that the best and most immediate answer for all of the family concerned, including the mother’s other children, is to abort the child who may well become such a drain on her already depleted resources and energy, as well as impinge badly on the other members of the family.

Rather than she being confronted by a person waving a placard outside an abortion centre, would it not be more loving and caring to have engaged with her earlier before she came to this extreme point? Maybe if she had been listened to and offered some support through a welfare agency or a friend or family member, she may not have felt the overwhelming need to take this extreme step to cope with the various pressures that she is facing. Instead of the pro-life protester sitting across from her waving a placard, they could have been sitting next to her, supporting her and encouraging her to nurture the child growing in her uterus, with a network of personal and financial support. It is all very well to compassionately focus on the little baby growing in her mother’s uterus, but that little baby needs more than a cheer squad on their side. They need a relatively stable family environment in which they can be truly nurtured by the wider community around them.

Equally, the older frail person, for whom the family have found a good Aged Care facility, may be tempted to feel that they have done the best they can for their ageing parents or partners. But as the recent Royal Commission into Aged Care has shown, as a nation we are far from providing safe and caring places for our elderly as we as a nation grow increasingly older. This is partly because we can never buy genuine love from strangers, and so people in these institutions need all the love and care and visits from us.

Jesus criticised the religious leaders in his day for the fact that they had created loopholes in their religious laws which minimised the amount of money that they needed to spend on their elderly. Additionally, Jesus is encouraging us to share the pain and anguish of what it means to grow old. We cannot just put elderly people out of our sight, nor devalue their importance by making them feel that they are a ‘burden’. **Euthanasia** is often considered, not so much to alleviate the pain of the elderly person, but to save us from having to carry them during these awfully difficult times in the latter stages of their life. Pain and suffering are part of life, which Jesus came to bear with us, and he gives us the deep love to carry people in these times.

Valuing children, babies and people and the elderly is not only a matter of having a nice feeling about them, but of being there for them, listening to their needs and discovering the gifts that they have to share with us. This takes time, energy and love, compassion and care. Often, especially at this busy time before Christmas, we do not have this energy, for much of our daily life is directed towards our expectations and our plans for Christmas and holidays. God asks each of us to slow down with him and walk with those who travel more slowly than we do, and to look at the world through their eyes of fascination and discovery, memories and experience. He asks us to draw on his Holy Spirit so that we see the world through the eyes of the unborn child as well as the elderly person in our midst.

We are entering into this time of Christmas where we celebrate the fact that God entered not only our world, but actually became a human with us. In this we hear two profound things. First of all, God is the one who values human beings most of all, even when we don’t. He loves every human being no matter who they are or what they have done or what they are like. God has joined himself to the human race in his Son Jesus forever. This fact has added the most unbelievable value to what it means to be a human. God himself now asks us to join him in looking at each other as valuable and precious, from conception to death until we finally arrive in heaven to share the life that he is preparing for us all in eternity. Let us celebrate this precious reality of the value of human beings, and live this reality with our family, friends and our enemies (especially those who have a different view of the value of human life).

**Some relevant and thoughtful Bible texts:**

- Psalm 139:13-16
- Matthew 10:24-31
- Psalm 8
- Matthew 6:26ff
- Genesis 1:26, 27
- 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17
- Mark 12:31

Suffering serves redemptive purposes. Hardship deepens our awareness of human frailty and mortality, encouraging us to depend more on God.

- 2 Corinthians 1:8,9
- Hebrews 2:14-18
- Hebrews 4:15, 16
- 1 Peter 4:19
- Matthew 14:14
- Matthew 9:36
- Colossians 3:12
- Romans 12:15 weep with those who weep.

**Human values**  are most  **important**  in  **life** — so **important**  that people are and should be ready to sacrifice almost anything to live with their  **values**. Honesty, integrity, love, and happiness are some of the end  **values**  or destination  **values**  that  **human** beings seek to attain, practise and live with.
