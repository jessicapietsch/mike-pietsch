## Environment and faith

### General background to Spirituality

I share these ideas from my particular Christian perspective, which comes out of a deep connection with the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament). This understanding of the Hebrew wisdom and relationship of God to earth and people is further developed through the life and death of Jesus the Messiah, and then how Jesus is particularly expressed and appreciated by **Martin Luther** and **Dietrich Bonhoeffer**.

My spirituality is found in the engagement of this understanding of God with each contemporary moment.

As Jesus says,

> ‘Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old’ (Matt 13:52).

This is a radical approach to life which does not accept or try to maintain the status quo, but is always anticipating new ways in which God will always be calling us into different ways of living and thinking. The Lutheran motto *semper reformanda* (continually reforming) is most pertinent in this respect.

This process of constant change is also balanced by an exploration of valuing the importance of the long-term perspective. For example, appreciating the value of the Queen of England for British politics, who provides a larger perspective to the fleeting ‘governments of the day’. This equally applies to an institution or organisation providing historical and cultural perspective for the current leadership and the decisions that it makes, whether this is a business corporation or a football club. It is this ‘bigger picture’ which I also discover and appreciate in my Christian faith, a deeper understanding of the world and universe. It also gives me as an appreciation for what we do and don’t know, along with a more objective openness for what has proved its value and gives clues for what are the most important things to pursue and shape our future.

Some of these perspectives come from the following:

1. A broader view of both life and death, as well as a perspective of life beyond death.
2. A view of the creation and evolution of the world that also involves the consideration of pre- and post-creation existence.
3. An appreciation for the complex and multi-layered levels of development including both micro- and macro-evolution.
4. An appreciation of the social developments of both the swinging pendulum from left to right (politically and figuratively), as well as the synergistic and conical movement of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis.
5. The importance of not only focussing on the positives or the negatives. Therefore, one does not fall into the naïve trap of humanistic optimism, nor a pessimistic, cynical and negative view of humans which is devoid of hope.
6. Appreciating that one should not be bound by scientific or social theories or movements (nor theological trends!), but rather view them one step back. With this perspective one realises that whatever is the latest theory is only a theory, and so one can be happily step outside and be gently critical of the current ideas being espoused. To see all life as valuable and sacred because it is God’s world. Even when we use parts of creation for our benefit (e.g. food to eat) to receive that gratefully and respectfully rather than just assuming it is ours. Seeing all of life as sacred means also valuing the good and the bad in the world, for there is very little that is clearly only good or bad, and much of it is grey in-between. But to know that God identifies himself with both good and bad, both beauty and death, (and grey) and can transform each part of it into a far larger whole.

**Norman Habel** writes in this way:

> This work of God is a ‘deep reconciliation’, a radical healing that reaches into all corners of the cosmos. How? By spectacular conquest? No! Peace is made ‘through the blood of the cross’. Peace is effected through the God who suffers on the cross and with creation. Embodied in that piece of Earth called Jesus Christ, God bonds with Earth in the battle against those forces of sin and evil that destroy peace and perpetuate alienation. In Christ, then, Earth too suffers and bears the cross. The land too is crucified with the incarnate God. God thereby liberates Earth.
> 
> The sin that Christ overcomes is not merely the personal wrong of human individuals, but the massive corporate sin and environmental injustice perpetrated against our planet. Christ is the ‘lamb of God’ who not only takes away my sins, but as our liturgy says, ‘the sins of the whole world’. And those sins include our crimes against creation. In short, God incarnate also dies for Earth. Earth and its human inhabitants are one.

1. Maintaining a dialectic of preserving the world, but not frantically seeing it as the be-all and end-all, ie literally idolising the world of nature. Rather, respectfully caring for the world, but knowing that it is also in a process of evolving, re-creating, changing and dying, both in the short-term and long-term. It is important to hold in tension these two realities of not idolising nature, nor neglecting nature “because it is all going to end one day, and it is there ‘for me’” (as some Christians wrongly espouse).
2. Theology also offers a perspective that shows that we need to be constantly changing and adapting our view of the world. This does not mean that either God or reality is a wax nose that is shaped according to our whim, but it does mean that our understanding and view of life is never 100% certain.

This reality is beautifully expressed by **Albert Einstein** in the following words:

> I am not an atheist, and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations.”

What has been received as revelation in scripture (the Bible, etc) has to be read as having been spoken into a certain time and situation. Containing deep truths about life and reality, it also has elements that are specifically only related to the context into which it was spoken. So when God said to Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, it was not an issue when the population barely existed. But to simply re-espouse this ‘command’ in an era when the world is bulging with human beings, is not to be reading the text in its time and context, and in reality to not be listening to the word of God. We abuse the text by seeing it as immutably written and then the words being valid for every time and context.

1. A theological perspective also keeps a balance between ‘church and state’. The church is to keep its distance from the ‘state’ which includes the pursuit of science, scholarship, education, public opinion, economics and politics. God has given humans not only the right but the responsibility to govern, care for and make good decisions themselves without the church constantly looking over their shoulder. The church should encourage scientific endeavour of both scientists who are Christians and non-Christians. The church however might need to be more actively involved when ethical boundaries are being breached or when the science is not living up to its responsibilities or abusing its power and people or the natural world in their care.
2. Decisions being made with the future generations in our hearts. How do we live today for not just ourselves but the future generations? The resources of the world are not just for today. Give us this day our daily bread, not our daily greed. Within all of this is, however, the trust that with God’s grace and our goodwill we can find solutions to providing for all and that we can move forward confidently, but also carefully, ie full of **care**  but also being  **carefree**.

### Specific Christian responses to Green issues

1. The Green Pope: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholemew I of Constantinople
2. Norm Habel’s Earth Bible
3. Various statements of affirmation for caring for the earth. This has been done by many individual church denominations as well as larger bodies such as the World Council of Churches, Lutheran World Federation, etc.

### A few thoughts

We are to do this with Christ and in the light of his grace and truth. Students, researchers and teachers are not only to approach their tasks to find out the truth, but when they discover new truths they are to use and apply them with grace, and not just for their own benefits or to manipulate the world in ways that are convenient for them, or for their own power trip or chance to make money or gain academic prestige. We could go on with every area of our lives.

We are not to deify the world as does animism and modern day ‘ *ecomania* ’ which sees the world as all that we have and in a frenetic way that is almost religious calls out to people in desperation to ‘save’.

But neither are we to just use the world for our own selfish and plundering ideas because it will one day come to an end. We are to see it as God’s world which we have been charged with managing and nurturing.
