## Do religion and politics mix?

### What is politics?

Politics is the process of relationships and living together at a macro level in a small (local council area), large (state politics), very large society (nation states) and between nation states (international politics).

### What is religion?

Religion (or faith/ spirituality) deals with our relationships with God and other people. This happens mostly at a personal and micro level, but its place and influence is only a matter of degree. It can be expressed by one individual or 1,000 million **Roman Catholic** s with the Pope as their spiritual/ religious head or the **World Council of Churches** which represents millions of Christians in the Roman, Orthodox and Protestant churches of almost 2 Billion people.

**Politics Religion**

Because both politics and religion involve relationships between people there will naturally be an area of overlap. This overlap may be even larger if it is assumed that political leadership comes under the authority of God.

### The method of politics:

The means by which politics operates are varied but essentially include power for good (but this can very easily become for evil and personal gain). This power uses fear, ‘stick and carrot’, information, science, history, reason discussion, (high) ideals, external measures, law and law enforcement (police). Politics can also use religion/ the heart and emotions in both positive and negative ways.

### The method of religion:

The means of religion are far more gentle and compassionate, which essentially, for the Christian faith, means unconditional love. This more specifically then includes grace, invitation, encouragement, generosity, internal and external effects, forgiveness and ethics (which are recommended rather than forced). Also included are extra-terrestrial beings and their powers: such as God, angels and the hosts of heaven.

### Eras of the relationship between religion and politics:

#### Pre-Christian:

Many peoples had a close connection between what we today call secular politics and religion. Often the king was connected with one or many deities. For the people of Israel the King was seen to be ‘God’s son’ (Psalm 2) or God’s representative and the King worked closely within and beside the priests and prophets. For Israel being the ‘people of God’ was synonymous with being ‘Israelites’ who lived in the ‘promised land’. This changed after the Babylonian exile when the Israelites returned to Israel and for the next centuries up until the time of Christ had some super-power over them (Persians, Greeks or Romans).

#### Early church in the Roman empire until the Emperor Constantine (ca. 315):

Jesus and the early Christian church grew in a political environment which did not understand it and tried to bring it under its control and hegemony. But the ‘otherness’ of the Kingdom of God and the Lordship of Jesus Christ did not fit comfortably under the Roman Emperor (consider Jesus before Pontius Pilate). The ‘otherness’ of the Kingdom of God includes a ‘theology of the cross’, servitude, humility, love for all people (including the enemy). So Christians were often seen as non-conformist if not actually politically subversive. Hence the ten organised periods of persecution against the church in its first 300 years disenfranchised the church away from the political process. However the New Testament writings generally encouraged respect and obedience towards the political powers.

#### Constantine until the demise of the Roman Empire:

Christianity becomes the ‘official’ religion of the Roman Empire. Christians can freely participate in the political processes. It was a time of relative peace and cooperation between the church and state.

#### Middle Ages:

After the demise of the Roman Empire in the 6 <sup>th</sup>  and 7 <sup>th</sup> centuries, the church entered the political vacuum. The political (‘Christian’) rulers become increasingly intertwined with the church, both its politics and theology. The idea of the Holy Roman Empire is subsequently developed with a long line of political Emperors governing Europe. So there are two main powers in the Western Christian world namely The Emperor and the Pope.

#### Reformation:

Luther called for a greater delineation between the church and state, believing that the church had become too entwined in politics. He popularised what came to be called the doctrine of the ‘two kingdoms’. This referred to the power of the state as the Kingdom on the Left and the church was referred to as the Kingdom on the Right. Both of these Kingdoms represented the two ‘hands of God, and so God had oversight of both, but they were quite distinct in many respects and had quite different roles to play.

On the other end of the political spectrum, Calvin’s Geneva attempted to create a society in which these two kingdoms were tightly held together, as in the days of the Israelites of the Old Testament. It failed. This highlighted the differing emphases of the Lutheran and Reformed church. The Lutheran church emphasised God’s grace and the humanity of the church while the Reformed church emphasised the Lordship and Sovereignty of Christ who rules his church.

#### The Enlightenment and Pietism:

During the time of the ‘Age of Reason’ religion was seen to have less of a place in many of the areas of the public areas of life, not just science. This emphasis was reflected in the French Revolution and so on. Many Christians went in to their shells and developed Pietism which focussed on the religion of the heart which was personal and spiritual and did not get involved with the worldly matters of life which are temporal, but focussed on the eternal and spiritual. It was this emphasis of which Hitler took advantage and created reasons why the established church did not stand up to Hitler. Hitler emphasised that the churches should not get involved in matters of the state. Hence the reason why the Confessing Church was forced underground and had to run illegal seminaries, etc.

#### Recently:

In recent decades **Liberation Theology** (partly influenced by people like Bonhoeffer) has become a swing in the active direction of church participation in the matters of the state, especially when it involves matters of injustice. Much has happened in South America in this way, but so in other parts of the world. An example of what has been happening in South America is seen in the movie “ *The Mission* ”. It has also created much controversy and debate by those who say that the church should not be so politically involved.

This brings us to differing between the **political responsibility of an established church** (representing many people, all of whom have a wide spectrum of political and possibly varying shades of theological opinions) and the individual Christian who acts in political matters. It also raises the question of to what extent you can have a Christian political party such as Family First and the DLP (Catholic political party in Australia of the 1950s and 1960s). The established church should only become involved when the state is not fulfilling its God-given role, such as the case with corruption or abuse of minorities or defenceless people. However, it is not always clear where the line is as to when ‘the church’ steps in. Also the question of timing is very important.

Jesus broke Jewish laws. Did he at any stage transgress the Roman law? He paid his taxes to Caesar (two coins found in the mouth of the fish). Jesus completely fulfils the Roman law and so he dies a totally innocent man, in terms of the civil authorities (who were the ones that put him to death).

There are always going to be problems when the state steps in to the realm of the religious (eg Nazism, Communism, current day policy in France whereby the Hijab and crosses are forbidden in public settings) or when the religion overrules and runs the state (eg an Islamic state, Calvin’s Geneva or the power of the Papacy in the Middle Ages.)

### Biblical texts relevant to this issue:

Matt 22:15-22; Romans 13:1 ff; 1Timothy 2:1,2; 1 Peter 2:13-17; Acts 4:19; Isaiah 56:9-12; Amos 6:1-7; Micah 3:1-12; 6:8; John 18:36; Acts 25:11; 22:25.

### Examples of Christians involved in politics:

Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Joh Bjelke Peterson; John Anderson; Steve Fielding; Peter Garret; Kevin Rudd; Obama; Desmund Tutu, Tony Abbott, Peter Costello, Paul Keating, John Howard, Carter, Senator Neville Bonner (aboriginal pastor), Wayne Goss, Ghandi.

### Ways in which a Christian can be personally involved in politics:

Voting, opinion polls/ surveys, keeping up with the news, discussion and questioning of others, street marches, sit-ins (Acts 16:16-39), appeal to the courts (Acts 22:25; 25:11), writing letters to politicians/ petitions.

It needs to be noted that silence is consent, and responsibility lies with the silent majority.

### Some thoughts from Bonhoeffer:

> \[The church\] is not concerned with the christianizing of the secular institutions or with subordinating them to the Church, that is to say, with abolishing their ‘relative’ autonomy; it is concerned rather with their true worldliness or ‘naturalness’ in obedience to God’s word. It is, therefore, precisely in their genuine worldliness that the secular institutions are subject to the dominion of Christ.

He goes on to point out that:

> ‘\[u\]nder the dominion of Christ \[secular institutions\] attain to their own true character and become subject to their own innate law, which is theirs according to the manner of their creation.’

Within *Christology* Bonhoeffer also deals with the understanding that for the Christian the state is seen as the left hand of God, administering justice, law and punishment.

He says:

> Christ is present to us in the forms both of Church and State. But he is this only for us…who since the cross must see the state in the light of Christ. The state is God’s ‘rule with his left hand’…So long as Christ was on earth, he was the kingdom of God. When he was crucified the kingdom broke up into one ruled by God’s right hand and one ruled by his left hand. Now, it can only be recognised in a twofold form, as Church and as State.

In interpreting Bonhoeffer’s Christology lectures, Pelikan makes the following observations:

> It is the function and essence of the state to enable a nation to move toward the fulfillment (sic) of its destiny. This the state does by the maintenance of law and order … The Cross has renewed the state as well as the Church, shattering and fulfilling and affirming the “secular order”. In this sense the real presence of Christ at the center of history takes a dual form.

The second major area of impact of Bonhoeffer’s Christology is history, described in this way (and this refers to what we would call the secular history of politics and nation states and regions):

> Were Christ shown to be the high point of all religion, that would still have nothing to do with his being the centre. A comparison with other relative appearances and, resulting from that, a possible proof that Christ was the centre of history would at the most give us a relative, not an absolute conclusion…The question about Christ as centre and boundary of history must be stated quite differently. History lives between promise and fulfilment.

This question of promise and fulfilment is closely tied to the person of a messiah figure who is often false or illusory. Christ exposes the emptiness of the false messiahs and becomes the messiah servant of history.

Bonhoeffer clearly points this out in his Christology lecture series:

> The promise of a Messiah is everywhere alive in history. History lives in and from this expectation…But history relates itself to this promise much as the individual person relates to the law: it cannot fulfil it…Only at one point does the thought break through that the Messiah cannot be the visible and demonstrated centre of history, but must be the hidden centre appointed by God…This fulfilled promise is not proved by anything, it is only to be proclaimed. This means that the Messiah, Christ, is at one and the same time the destroyer and fulfiller of all the messianic expectations of history…The meaning of history is found in the humiliated Christ…History is here led to its boundary with its own promises…Yet, by setting this boundary, Christ has at the same time again become its centre and its fulfilment. When the totality of history should stand before God, there Christ stands. He is also the *pro me* for history.

And so Christ fulfils the Messianic figure when every other messianic figure never lives up to the expectations and promises (Barak Obama is the current Messianic figure for many). Thus there will always be a tension between the Kingdom of God as ushered in by Jesus and the Kingdoms of this world in their many manifestations. However, until Christ’s second coming God continues to hold together our communities through the many levels of political government as they preserve, nurture and protect their citizens. But there will always be a tension as to who is ultimately in control. Christians will always have a higher authority to whom they owe allegiance than the government of the day, and this will occasionally bring them in to conflict with the civil authorities. However, the general relationship that Christians will have with the government is that of being supportive and obedient, recognising that God has placed it there for the good of the community.
