When Christ was on earth, he prayed that the church would be one, as he and the Father are one (John 17:20-26). Apart from a few minor disputes, this prayer was answered in an institutional or organisational sense for the first 1000 years of the church’s existence. It was soon after the turn of the first millenium that the church split into its Eastern and Western divisions, the Roman Catholic Church in the West, based in Rome, and the Eastern Orthodox Church based in Constantinople (modern day Istanbul).

The ostensible reason for the division was the ‘ ***filioque*** ’ (‘who proceeds from the Father ‘and the Son’). ‘… and the Son’ was included in the Nicene Creed by the Western Church but not the Eastern Church. However, scholars also note significant other factors, such as differences in language (Latin in the West and Greek in the East).

Additionally, there were differences over **styles of government** in the church. Up until then there had been five primary centres of authority or primacy (Constantinople, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem). They operated on the basis that the Archbishop of either Constantinople or Rome was the ‘first among equals’. But a dispute arose who was to be the ‘first’, Rome or Constantinople. Amidst all of this miscommunication and power politics, the church split into the Roman Church of the West and the Orthodox Churches of the East, and remain so to this day. The Reformation in the Western church in the 16 <sup>th</sup> century splintered the Western church even more.

Our response to this question ‘Why does the church have so many denominations?’, very much depends on what we define as ‘church’. If by ‘church’ we mean the universal church as expressed in the body of Christ, then the church has been, and always will be a single unity and entity, without division. This is a reality which is too easily forgotten when Christians focus more on **what and how** they believe rather than **in whom** they believe, i.e. the **Triune God** as expressed in the Universal Creeds of the church written in the first 500 years when the church was organisationally unified. These creeds, in particular the ‘ **Apostles Creed** ’ and the ‘ **Nicene Creed** ’ were universally debated, worked on and finally agreed at the Ecumenical Councils. These two creeds were formulated in two of the seven councils held during the first 1000 years of church history.

There have always been **factions in the church** to varying degrees. The first three chapters of St Paul’s letter to the Corinthians details this (especially 1:10-17 and 3:1-23; Titus 3:2), as do other parts of the New Testament, such as the first three chapters of the book of Galatians (1:6-3:29). Various other passages note in passing differences and potential divisions that might occur (e.g. Phil 4:2-3). The body of Christ calls every human being into it, and therefore the church is called to be the most diverse group of individuals in the world. By its very diverse nature and the varied backgrounds of people, there will be differences of opinion and differences of approach. This is a diverse reality which can be used positively or negatively.

It can be used negatively to exclude people from the Kingdom of God and dismiss people from this dynamic process that nurtures a diverse community. This may be expressed by individuals publicly describing who is and who is not inside the church or the Kingdom of God. To those who make this pronouncement could be asked whether they are acting like ‘God’, and taking over his role as judge before the end of the age. Since the **Reformation** some parts of the Protestant church have almost made a life-style out of dismissing other Christians and forming yet another break-away group that has the ‘four-square’ Gospel, the absolutely correct version of the truth. Having left behind the power of the Pope and his ‘authoritarian’ structure that took over Christ’s role, we instead have many mini-Popes who proclaim that only they have the correct understanding of the Word of God and the accurate, ‘God-inspired’ knowledge about where the church should be heading.

However, one can use these differences creatively and positively in another way. We can affirm the unity of the church and respect our fellow **Christians in differing denominations**, but respectfully call to task various practices and teachings that do not seem to conform to the will of God or the Word of God in both our own denomination and in others. This may be compared to the differences that occur within a family who love and respect each other, but nevertheless do have some decent and honest fights at times, sometimes about trivial issues, but at other times about major problems. If they are able to actively listen, discuss and debate all sides of the argument, they can then come away better informed and able to make a better decision with all parties involved. This process also brings them closer together, even if there are a few hurt egos and some non-essential issues that had to be compromised.

A major part of the issue is the determination of what is **essential** and what is **peripheral**. On what things do we have to maintain agreement and which areas can be considered secondary or of a personal or local nature? For many denominations the **three Ecumenical Creeds are basic**, namely the Nicene, Apostolic and Athanasian. But these are often only the starting point for major teachings or emphases that are present in various denominations.

One very helpful way of approaching this issue is the following saying:

> In things necessary, unity.  
> In things dubious, liberty.  
> In all things, charity.

### Where do all our denominations come from?

- Dialogue between church bodies: (Is this a waste of time? What are the benefits? There have been various agreements, eg WCC Lima agreement on Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (BEM), Lutheran/ RCC Justification Agreement
- What can individuals do?
- What of inter-church marriages?
- What can congregations do?
- What is the role of the Ecumenical Movement?
- Will all churches this side of heaven be united under the one church banner?
- How important is it to take a stand for clear teaching? Col. 2:16-19. Note the First Church Council at Jerusalem Acts 15:1ff, especially verses 23-29.

Nicolaitans Rev 2:6, 9,14,15; 2:20, 24. See also 1 Cor 5:1-13; 2 Tim 3:1-9; 4:1-5; Titus 1:10-16; 2:15.
