Initially this question seems to be provocative, and it has partly been constructed in this way. But the more I have read and thought about it, the more I believe that it can help us to understand Jesus from a new perspective, plumbing the depths of whom Jesus Christ really is, what is the liberating Gospel, and what it means to be one of his disciples (ie a Christian).

**Anarchism** is quoted in Wikipedia as “ *a political philosophy which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or anarchy.*

### 1\. Jesus’ life and teaching

a. The establishment of a new community/ society/ Kingdom by Jesus threatened the political and religious systems of his (and every) time which included the Roman Empire (which it eventually outlasted). It also ruffled the Jewish political hierarchy in Palestine at the time, as well as the religious (often legalistic) theological systems of the Pharisees and Sadducees (the two main Jewish groupings in the time of Jesus).

To varying degrees Jesus challenged all these systems, threatening to replace them with a community that was not primarily based on laws but on love, forgiveness, compassion and non-domination of one person over another (the opposite of power politics). This new Kingdom of Jesus was to be led not by a new set of rules, but by the Spirit of God who leads in all sorts of ways that are often totally unpredictable and seemingly chaotic, yet at their heart liberating for all people. An essential feature of this new Kingdom of God is for all people to be invited to be servants of one another, thus undermining the normal systems of the day which usually emphasize strength and power.

Jesus demonstrated and spoke about a community not of power and domination, but of service and love in which there were no authorities or leaders, but one in which ‘Anyone who wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else’ (Mark 9:35). He spoke these words to his disciples who were to be the ‘leaders’ of this new community. When the disciples were jostling for their leadership roles and aspirations, Jesus said to them:

> ‘You know that in this world kings are tyrants and officials lord it over the people beneath them. But among you it should be quite different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be a slave of all. For even I, the Son of Man, came here not to be served, but to serve others, and to give my life as a ransom for many.’ (Mark 10:42-45)

Jesus said: ‘You will know the truth and the truth will set you free’ (John 8:32). Jesus’ primary task was to set people free, not only from their sins, but also from the many societal and religious restrictions which bind and control people and ‘keep them in place’. These included liberation for women from male/ female stereotypes; rescuing children from the lie that they are not important or significant; freeing and loving sick people by embracing them both when they are sick as well as when they are made well; revaluing social outcasts (‘tax-collectors’ and ‘sinners’, lepers and prostitutes) who are of as much worth as anybody else, and so on.

Jesus promised that after his death, resurrection and return to heaven, that he would send the Holy Spirit to everyone who became one of his disciples. The Holy Spirit would live in the heart of each person and guide and lead them to know how they should specifically love God and other people (see Romans 8:1ff and Galatians 5:1ff, especially vv 13-26).

The early church was also seen by the hegemonic Roman Empire as a threat to its authority and power. Subversively the Christian community continued to oppose the ultimate god-like authority which the Emperors claimed they had. Unfortunately, as the church gained the upper hand over the Roman Empire, it took on some of the same power features of the hegemony which it had originally called into question.

The term and movement of ‘Christian Anarchy’ was only formulated at the end of the 19 <sup>th</sup> century as a way of describing Tolstoy’s book called ‘The Kingdom of God Is Within You’. In this Tolstoy rejects violence and the close association of the church with the state, especially in connection with the waging of war. ‘Tolstoy takes the viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support these governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of nonviolence and nonresistance \[as especially found in the Gospels, particularly the Sermon on the Mount\]’ (Wikipedia article on Christian anarchism).

Even in the Old Testament there is a strong movement for no human government. We see this in the parable of the fruit trees and the brambles, in which the fruit trees are happily busy with creating their respective fruits. By contrast the brambles (which only have thorns and produce no fruit) have time on their hands and offer to be the ruler over all the plants (Judges 9:8-21). The fact that they had no central ruler for many years is finally replaced with God answering the people’s request for a king. God did not want there to be a human king, but rather for his twelve tribes to keep living with God as king. God would then send his prophet(s) or judge(s) when necessary to address whatever social, defense or legal problem was being faced.

### Out of this Biblical background the following points can be made:

1. This meant that when **Jesus** stood before the Roman authorities (in the person of Pontius Pilate) he said: ‘My kingdom is not from this world’ (John 18:36). And his followers spoke to the Roman authorities saying ‘We must obey God rather than men’. (Acts 5:29) This is a text that has been often quoted by dissident Christian groups right down to the ‘subversive’ Confessing Church which Hitler was trying to destroy during the beginning of the Nazi era in 1933-1937.
2. History describes various ways in which **anarchic communities** have formed, based around Jesus and his teaching. These include many monastic communities which question the institutions and values of the day, and passionately opt for a very different life-style which rejects materialism, power and a self-centred lifestyle. This was evident in the radical rejection of his family and the community of the day by St Francis of Assissi. Even in a small way we see practices such as all the pastors in the Lutheran Church of Australia receiving the same allowance (or pay) whether they are the head of the church or a lecturer in the seminary or a first-year-out pastor. Pay is not made on the basis of ‘merit’ or ‘experience’. All are supported equally.
3. **Christian Pacifism and anarchism**  
	have been closely tied together by various Christian groups including the Fransciscans, Quakers and other individuals who have taken active stands against military action, such as Westerners entering war zones in order to disrupt the targets of the Western military.
4. **Antinomianism**  
	Antinomianism literally means ‘without laws’ and it has been ascribed to Christians who down the ages of church history have denied the use or significance of living by laws. This has been done to varying degrees. Even though I would not affirm a strict antinomian position, I believe the intention of the antinomians has much to commend. Let me say from the outset that I believe that human beings in general need to have laws to keep people from hurting and abusing others. This level of law is primarily carried out by the government of the day and is a very basic guideline as to how we should live. However, I greatly appreciate Petr Chelcicky’s statement that ‘The man who obeys God needs no other authority (over him)’ and Ammon Hennacy’s quote which says: ‘An anarchist is anyone who doesn’t need a cop to tell him what to do’. Carl Jung perceptively makes the point: ‘Jesus pointed humanity to the truth that where force rules there is no love, and where love reigns force does not count.’

As a child of God and brother of Jesus Christ I am now called to operate in a far more subtle and positive way than just obeying a set of laws. I am called to be ‘led by the Spirit, and I am not under the law’ (Gal 5:18). And we know how the Spirit can sometimes lead in strange and unexpected ways (cf Numbers 11:24-30; I Sam 10:11; Acts 2:1-13). But the Spirit can also lead in ways that do not retaliate, that love instead of fight back. ‘But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law’. (Gal 5:22)

1. The **secular anarchistic movement** began in the 19 <sup>th</sup> century and included Christian anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy: ‘The Kingdom of God is Within You’ (Closer to communist anarchism)

‘WHAT WOULD JESUS DECONSTRUCT?’

The good news of postmodernism for the church by John Caputo Baker Academic 9780801031366 $32.95

Many in the church are wrestling with ministry in a postmodern world. They tend to view deconstruction as a negative aspect of the postmodern movement but John Caputo argues that, in his own way, Jesus himself was a deconstructionist and that applying deconstruction to the church can be a positive move toward renewal.

If you have access to the book (in ALC library) titled ‘The Promise of Lutheran Ethics’, and if you can handle technical theology and some philosophy, then I would recommend the chapter by Reinhard Hütter called “The Twofold Center of Lutheran Ethics: Christian Freedom and God’s commandments.” The title says it all. These two must always go together and never played off against each other otherwise we risk either legalism or antinomianism. The challenge of evangelical ethics is to navigate between these two potentially destructive rocks.

Some Bible verses that call for freedom from the law and freedom for God’s people:

- Exodus 3:7, 10
- Matt 22:36-40
- Luke 17:21
- John 14:23, 30
- Romans 6:14; 8:1-9; 10:4; 12:1,2; 13:8-10;
- I Cor 9:20-22
- Gal 2:17-21; 5:1-25; 6:2,14-16
- Hebrews 8:10; 10:1,16
- James 2:8,12,13
- Jesus lived the outsider/ alternative/ counter-cultural life style out in the natural world. See John 7:53

There is a Christian Anarchist organisation in Australia and New Zealand called Christianarchy. It has an annual conference, hosted alternately between Australia and New Zealand.
