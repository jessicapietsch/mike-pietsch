**The New Testament period lasted from 5 BC until about 90 AD**, basically the first century of the Christian church. During this time we have Jesus growing up and his ministry. After that comes the life of the early church, until the last of the Apostle’s dies around 90 AD (probably St John). During this time, the only ‘Bible’ they had was the Hebrew (Jewish) Scriptures.

Initially it was all remembered and re-recited in the early church community. More than likely, Jesus teachings were recorded down on a possible manuscript which has not survived but seems to have been used by all the Gospel writers (often referred to as Q (*Quelle* is the German word for ‘source’).

**The earliest documents of the New Testament** were the letters of St Paul, especially ones such as 1 Corinthians (ca 55 AD). Soon after, the Gospels started to appear.

There was **critical and public opposition** immediately after Jesus’ death and resurrection. This initially came especially from the Jews with whom the early Christians had close contact. Later the Romans also were very critical at various times. Hence, there was real pressure to record all events very accurately and honestly. Also, in the face of all this opposition the early church leaders suffered, not profiting financially, personally, or gaining honour and power, but rather poverty, scorn, imprisonment and death.

The **ancient memory** was far superior and well-trained compared to today when we rely on books and more recently all the technological information storage. For example, people were able to memorise and recite Homer’s Odyssey and the Illiad which consists of 24,000 lines of poetry.

Even in these early years, the importance of the **letters written by the apostles** and those who had direct contact with Jesus were noted. The letters of Paul were even cross-referenced and noted by other books at this time.

In 2 Peter 3:15, 16:

> ‘Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.’

Initially, the **20 main books of the first century** were well and truly accepted by all the church leaders. The **second category of books was the seven** which were up for discussion as to their authenticity, due to the fact that it was not absolutely certain who wrote them, namely: Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation.

The **third category** that were not accepted included **Gnostic variations of the Christian message** which were written after the first century and often used pseudonyms to give them credibility. Some were seen as worthy of reading, others were not very helpful and some were seen as heretical. Some were often rehashes of the earlier documents of the New Testament, and others took advantage of the aspects of Jesus life that were not central and which were not covered in detail by the original accounts (in the four Gospels). This includes Jesus’ boyhood, his adulthood before he began his ministry, and so on. Many of these were discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in about 1947 and include other ‘Gospels’ such as the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, Gospel of Mary, the Secret Gospel of Mark, etc.

During the first several centuries of the transmission of the message, considerable debate turned on **safeguarding its authenticity**. Three key methods of addressing this survive to the present day: [ordination](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination), where groups authorize individuals as reliable teachers of the message; [creeds](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed), where groups define the boundaries of interpretation of the message; and  [canons](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon), which list the primary documents certain groups believe contain the message originally taught by Jesus.

Books that were not accepted into the canons are now termed [***apocryphal***](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha). Some of them were vigorously suppressed and survive only as fragments. The earliest lists of canonical works of the  [New Testament](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament)  were not quite the same as modern lists; for example, the  [Book of Revelation](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation)  was regarded as disputed by some  [Christians](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian)  (see  [Antilegomena](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilegomena)), while  [Shepherd of Hermas](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_of_Hermas)  was considered genuine by others, and appears (after the Book of Revelation) in the  [Codex Sinaiticus](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus).

The ***antilegomena***  or “disputed writings” were widely read in the Early Church and included the  [Epistle of James](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_James), the  [Epistle of Jude](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_Jude), [2 Peter](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Peter), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_John)  and  [3 John](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_John), the  [Book of Revelation](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation), the  [Gospel of the Hebrews](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews), the  [Epistle to the Hebrews](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews), the  [Apocalypse of Peter](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Peter), the  [Acts of Paul](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Paul), the  [Shepherd of Hermas](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_of_Hermas), the  [Epistle of Barnabas](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_Barnabas)  and the  [Didache](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_the_Apostles).[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilegomena#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKalin2002-2) [<sup>[3]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilegomena#cite_note-3) The term “disputed” should therefore not be misunderstood to mean “false” or “heretical”. There was disagreement in the Early Church on whether the respective texts deserved canonical status.

The [**Syriac Peshitta**](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_Peshitta), used by all the various Syrian Churches, originally did not include 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation (and this  [canon](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon)  of 22 books is the one cited by  [John Chrysostom](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom)  (~347-407) and  [Theodoret](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoret)  (393-466) from the  [School of Antioch](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Antioch)).[<sup>[6]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha#cite_note-ntcanon1-6) Western Syrians have added the remaining five books to their New Testament canons in modern times [<sup>[6]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha#cite_note-ntcanon1-6) (such as the *Lee Peshitta*  of 1823). Today, the official  [lectionaries](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectionary)  followed by the  [Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malankara_Syrian_Orthodox_Church)  and the  [East Syriac](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Syrian_Rite) [Chaldean Catholic Church](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldean_Catholic_Church), which is in communion with the  [Holy See](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See), still only present lessons from the 22 books of the original Peshitta.[<sup>[6]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha#cite_note-ntcanon1-6)

The [Armenian Apostolic](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic)  church at times has included the  [Third Epistle to the Corinthians](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians), but does not always list it with the other 27 canonical New Testament books. This Church did not accept Revelation into its Bible until 1200 CE.[<sup>[7]</sup>](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha#cite_note-7) The New Testament of the Coptic Bible, adopted by the Egyptian Church, includes the two [Epistles of Clement](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015155915/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistles_of_Clement).

The **27 books of the NT canon** was finally decided by a Synodical Council in the fourth century, but essentially what it did was confirm what had been accepted and happening *de facto* for the previous three centuries by the vast majority of the early Christian church.

The following quotes describe this in the following way:

> “…the canon is a list of authoritative books more than it is an authoritative list of books. These books didn’t derive their authority from being selected; each one was authoritative before anyone gathered them together”

> “The most travelled roads in Europe are the best roads; that’s why they’re so heavily travelled”

> “It is the simple truth to say that the NT books became canonical because no one could stop them doing so.”
