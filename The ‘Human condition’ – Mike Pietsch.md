**Sermon for Advent 3, 13/12/2020  
**

Have you ever heard it expressed that **babies are so pure** and innocent when they are born? From this comes this **idea that we are all born essentially ‘good** ’.

This is a view of some religions and philosophies, especially humanism, and of many people in general. It is thought that our life experiences, other people and various social factors shape the innocent baby to learn to do wrong and act in bad ways as they observe and copy those around them. So, from starting out perfect and innocent, we learn to do wrong and be self-centred from the corrupt society around us. The danger of this view of humans is that as children and adults we do not personally own our evil actions and our responsibility for doing wrong things. We can blame them on other people and what has happened to us in the past. It is not our fault.

Does this blame-shifting sound familiar in the **context of Adam and Eve** when they first sinned in the Garden of Eden?

**John the Baptist** came to point out the confronting reality that we are not as good as we would like to think we are. The humanists among us, who do not recognize God in the world, call this negative side of us: **‘the human condition’**.

**Humans have a tendency to do evil.** It is what the most interesting and realistic novelists describe as they point out the flaws in the characters in their books. It is these flaws that get us into a tangle of damaging and disruptive behaviour, along with our accompanying twisted thoughts and words. The problem with the humanist position is that despite the ‘human condition’, it nevertheless sees human beings as essentially good and able to get itself out of this mess. The emphasis is one-sidedly on the positive behaviour or potential of human beings, often then minimising the negative aspects of humans deep down in our psyche. This leaves us with the expectation of pulling ourselves up by our own boot straps to be better people.

This one-sided ‘positive’ view of people can sometimes be a reaction to the **hell-fire and brimstone preaching of the church focusing on our sinful nature**. These negative experiences of people with the church can certainly create the poor self-image that people carry, both within the church and those that have given up on it. The negative self-image that is created by this lop-sided over emphasis on sin and the evil in people can cripple people’s self-confidence psychologically and spiritually.

Another reason why some people only emphasize the positive side of their humanity is because they are proud and arrogant and do not believe that they have evil inside of themselves. Or they think that if there is evil in humans that it is not in them, but that it is in people who are ‘below’ them. They believe that they have risen above evil and are far better individuals than other people.

But what about an innocent baby, such as **my five-month-old granddaughter** in Scotland? Does she have such a pure nature that she shines with innocent love all the time? Is she self-centred, or is she considerate of other people? Does she love other people unconditionally, or only if they look after her and keep her warm and fed? Are those big, ‘innocent’ eyes used for luring unsuspecting adults into caring for her? Or do they show genuine compassion and love? If there was another baby next to her and both babies were hungry and crying, would she offer or suggest or allow the other baby to be fed first, or at least share the milk?

These are somewhat speculative ways of looking at what constitutes a baby’s nature. But the main question is: can we **recognize that a new-born infant has two contrasting natures**, even opposite and paradoxical sides? She is created in the image of God with amazing qualities, beauties, complexities and beguiling eyes and attractiveness, as well as a sweet nature. But she is also self-centred and turned in on herself and will think about herself before others.

**Luther** describes all human beings, from the time they are born, as ‘ **curved in on themselves** ’ and primarily seeing themselves as the centre of the universe. So as a baby, child or adult, they take priority before other people, and they also have priority before their Creator and Lord. In fact, we become our own ‘god’, judging ourselves and others and looking after our needs first and foremost.

The problem of the humanists is that they have fallen for the simplistic lie that people are born perfect or innocent. As with all of Satan’s warped views of life, he is the master of half-truths. It is true that we are created in the perfect image of God. But it is also true that ever since we decided that we could get on better without God in our lives, or with God at a convenient distance, we have discovered that we have many tiny hairline fractures through us. We are like a china tea pot with hairline cracks tessellated all through it. Rather than fool ourselves that we are essentially good, we need to be honest and ‘ **fess up about our brokenness**, otherwise we cannot be genuinely restored.

This is the task of **John the Baptist**. Before our Saviour Jesus Christ came, John was there to help us to honestly admit our wrongs and brokenness. It is only when we do so that the deep relevance and work of Jesus can reach into our lives and transform us from the inside out with the power of the Holy Spirit. Then, when we recognize the darkness inside of us, we can more fully appreciate Jesus as the light and love of God coming into the world. We can then see Jesus as the reconnector of our lives with God. We do not have to beat ourselves into the ground through our guilt or develop a negative self-image of ourselves, but just be honest about the fault-lines in our lives.

If the root of the evil in us is not cut out, we are very clever at putting a superficial paper mache over the external part of our lives. Then we cover the source of the evil inside ourselves without truly dealing with it. And then the selfish focus inside of us expresses itself in all sorts of twisted ways, because it is still there.

The religious leaders of Jesus’ day were the epitome of this, as Jesus pointed out. He called them white gravestones. White on the outside but full of filth, arrogance, greed, and two-faced standards on the inside.

The Pharisees who came to Jesus did not want to hear that they had to be born again, that they needed the washing of John’s baptism to prepare them for the coming Messiah. They had built a religious structure of good deeds and actions which put them at the top of the heap, well and truly above the supposed ‘scum’ at the bottom.

By contrast, Jesus praises the candid honesty of people who freely admit that they are not the people they should be. These people admit that they are at the bottom of the pile of humanity, and they come to God humbly, looking to receive washing and a fresh start with God.

This is what John’s baptism was all about: recognizing that we are all at the bottom of the pile and that we all need a new and fresh start from the inside to the outside. And we cannot do it by ourselves. We have tried that and failed abysmally. When we focus on Jesus Christ and who he is and what he has done, then we have deep down forgiveness, lasting joy and peace. It is not up to us. We know that we are loved and forgiven because of what Jesus has done for us. We are liberated from having to look at ourselves and assess whether we are good enough or acceptable. To be able to freely admit our guilt and leave it behind at Jesus’ feet is truly liberating. This is the deep-down joy that the baby in Bethlehem is wanting us to see and experience. It is yours. It is mine. It is for all.
