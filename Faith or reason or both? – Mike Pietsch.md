## Can faith and reason exist together?

### 1\. The faith/reason continuum.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20250312050945im_/https://mikepietsch.thoughtfulworks.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-9.13.08-am-1-1024x154.png)

### 2\. Well-known people who have affirmed both faith and reason:

- **Thomas Aquinas:**  
	He combined both his understanding of Greek philosophy (and logic) with his Christian faith in his thinking and writing about how these two basic areas of life hold together.
- **Martin Luther and many theologians:**  
	Theologians down the centuries have developed critical and logical methods for examining the Bible and its message and for then applying it to the current philosophies at the time. This has required extensive university education involving critical reasoning and thinking, but at the same time realising that one does not make a ‘god’ out of reason itself.
- **Galileo:**  
	“I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use”
- **Blaise Pascal:**  
	Mathematician, scientist and philosopher: Suggested the ‘wager with life and its four-fold possibilities’. “What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how monstrous, how chaotic, how prodigious! Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, repository of truth, sink of doubt and error, and glory and refuse of the universe. These contrarities, he thought, cried out for an explanation.” See also his writings in: ‘Christianity for Modern Pagans: Pascal’s Pensees Edited, Outlined and explained’ by P Kreeft.
- **Mendel:**  
	He was an Augustinian monk who was one of the pioneers of biology and discovered the first laws of heredity.
- **C. S. Lewis:**  
	Initially a confirmed atheist who was an Oxford scholar, who then describes himself as having been ‘dragged into the Kingdom of God’. He wrote prolifically in the area of reason and faith: ‘The Problem of Pain’, ‘Surprised by Joy’, ‘Mere Christianity’, ‘Miracles’, Narnia Chronicles, etc.
- **Antony Flew:**  
	An active and publicly promoting atheist almost his whole life as a university lecturer and writer of philosophy in England. His writings were used to powerfully support atheism in the second half of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century. But then he took seriously the arguments for the existence of God and found the logical evidence to be stronger than he had originally seen. This is partly because the biological evidence for the complexity of life and the universe has been increasing exponentially in recent years and the calculation of this by physicists places the odds on it happening randomly as almost totally remote.
- **Francis Collins:**  
	Head of the Human Genome Project. Originally an agnostic and then an atheist at university, he went on to have his atheistic faith challenged by some of his patients, and after taking up the logical challenge discovered faith. He now combines his faith and his scientific work, particularly in relation to genetics and evolutionary theory. He rejects Intelligent design but has developed what he calls Bio-logos, which is a combination of science and faith in harmony.
- **Owen Gingerich:**  
	He is a noted Harvard astronomer who produced a book in 2006 called ‘God’s Universe’ in which he says ‘the universe has been created with intention and purpose, and this belief does not interfere with the scientific enterprise.’
- **Paul Davies:**  
	He is a cosmologist of international repute, who in the same year (2006 which was also the year that Dawkins produced his book ‘The God Delusion’) produced a book called ‘The Goldilocks Enigma’. In this he argues for ‘fine-tuning’ in the universe. The bio-friendliness of the universe points to an overarching principle that somehow pushes the universe towards the development of life and mind.
- **Alistair McGrath:**  
	He was initially an atheist who later lectured in the History of Christian Thought. However, his atheism lapsed due to his study of the philosophy of science. He then studied Christian theology, specialising in the history of Christian thought. He has since written several books about his colleague Richard Dawkins including a scathing but rational response to ‘The God Delusion’ which is called ‘The Dawkins Delusion’

#### Survey of the belief of scientists in 1916 and 1997

- **1916** — 40% believed in a personal God; 40% atheists; 20% not sure
- **1997** — 40% believed in a personal God; 45% atheists; 15% not sure

The definition of ‘personal God’ was quite specific in that it meant a God who would hear and answer prayer.

### 3\. The sharper edges of reason and the softer edges of faith (or trust).

Note in the diagram below, that the ‘hard sciences’ have two straight edges (in the four corners), depicting a greater reliance on logic and rationality and hard-nosed evidence. But even these disciplines have their premises or elements of ‘faith’.

For example, as a community, mathematicians agree to a set of axioms with which to work, such as the current number system, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.). Equally, history and theology, art, language, etc all have aspects of system and reason, logic and rationality as well as their premises and more subjective expressions and conclusions.

The central areas are more personal (family, friendship, etc). But they are connected to areas of logic (the outer parts of the ‘puzzle of life’), sharing boundaries with them. These connections with the hard and harder sciences they use in developing and maintaining relationships. They also have an element of total love (in the very centre), but only partially.

The central inner piece of the puzzle is the inner one of total and unconditional love which can ultimately be seen as totally irrational and self-denying: the unconditional love of God who passionately and recklessly died on the cross for all creation is the most supreme example that we have of this.

The Jigsaw of life

Both Stephen Jay Gould (leading American biologist) and Sir Martin Rees (President of the Royal Society in England) acknowledge that science has its limits and cannot answer every question or problem in the world. However, Richard Dawkins cannot believe that these highly reputable scientists would admit this. Dawkins believes that science can explain every aspect of what it means to be a human being. However, most scientists and philosophers would agree that the great questions of life are beyond or deeper than scientific calculation. Some of these are: How did everything begin? What are we all here for? What is the point of living? Is life just totally random, or is there a purpose in life?

### 4\. Paradox

1. Free-will/ determinism. Both of these have their elements of truth, even though they are seemingly opposite.
2. Light is understood by physicists as both a wave and particle
3. Subjective/ participant and objective/ observer. No one can ever fully objectively view a situation because to some degree they are part of the situation, just by the fact that they are in the world. Therefore, no one can be totally objective, which in the past scientists naively thought they could be.
4. Reason/ faith

### 5\. Layers of reality:

- Nature/ science/ physical world
- Personal consciousness
- Community/ love/ friendship
- Moral values/ decisions
- Beauty/ arts
- Faith/ religion/ worldviews

### 6\. Trust and reason

What is the relationship between trust (faith) and reason (logic and science)? How do we make everyday decisions in life? What component of the decision is trust and which is reason?

The following diagram represents how faith can use reason and argument, analysis and scientific rigour in assessing both itself and its tenets, as well as the documents and primary sources on which it is based. But then these matters of logic can never ultimately ‘prove’ that God exists, or that Jesus was God or that love is central in our lives. The area of logic, however, can defuse the arguments against faith and also provide reasonable explanations that show that God and faith may also be part of the universe in which we live.

### 7\. Truth

Is there such a thing as ‘truth’? Is it at least an ideal that we are all in the process of discovering, by means of both reason and faith? The traditional concept of truth involves the following factors:

1. Objective
2. Universal
3. Intelligible
4. Intellectual
5. Moral
6. Aesthetic

In our Post-Modern age, do we subscribe to the new idea that there is no truth and that everything is relative? Or do we accept that there may be something greater or more truthful? Is not the whole concept of a university an embodiment of that search as scholars attempt to find a better and more closer description of the world around us, including in the Arts and sciences?

The following quotes (below) and the concluding thoughts come from a book called ‘The Case for Faith’ written by Lee Stroebel, a journalist who was once an adamant atheist. He took on the questions of faith by sceptically interviewing very many people about faith, and through this process became a Christian himself as he looked at faith through both sceptical and open eyes.

> “Those who believe they believe in God without passion in the heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, and even at times without despair, believe only in the idea of God, and not in God himself.” )

Many spiritual seekers have legitimate questions concerning Christianity and need to pursue answers that will satisfy their heart and soul. Yet I think some seekers get to the point where they are subconsciously raising smoke screens to mask their deep-seated motivations for rejecting the faith.

The same is true for Christians who fall prey to doubts about their beliefs. Often, they’re having a bout of sincere misgivings about some aspects of their faith; other times, however, their professed doubts may actually be a subtle defense mechanism. They may think they’re hung up over an objection to some part of Christianity, when the reality is that they’re actually casting around for some excuse— *any* excuse—not to take Jesus more seriously. .

Stroebel gives a personal example himself when confronted by Leslie’s (his wife) comments with reference to him questioning the genuineness of the conversion of a notorious gang member:

> ‘I went on and on, my hypotheses getting more and more outlandish as I speculated about the real reason he was turning himself in. I considered every far-out possibility — except that he had decided to do the right thing by facing the consequences for his crime. Finally, Leslie put up her hand. “Whoa, whoa,” she said. “Those are pretty bizarre theories.” She put down her cup and looked me in the eyes. “Tell me something,” she said with an edge to her voice. “Are you trying to poke holes in his story because you really think he’s \[Jesus\] a con man? Or are you raising objections because you don’t want his story to be true?”’
> 
> I jumped on the defensive. “Hey”, I shot back, “Its my job to be sceptical!”
> 
> But she had struck a nerve. To be honest, I didn’t want to believe that Christianity could radically transform someone’s character and values. It was much easier to raise doubts and manufacture outrageous objections than to consider the possibility that God actually could trigger a revolutionary turn-around in such a depraved and degenerate life.

Garry Parker says in his book ‘The Gift of Doubt’ (1990):

> “If faith never encounters doubt, if truth never struggles with error, if good never battles with evil, how can faith know its own power? In my own pilgrimage, if I have to choose between a faith that has stared doubt in the eye and made it blink, or a naïve faith that has never known the firing line of doubt, I will choose the former every time.”

> If faith and doubt can co-exist, then this means that people don’t have to fully resolve each and every obstacle between them and God in order to have an authentic faith. In other words, when the preponderance of all the evidence tilts decisively in God’s favour, and a person then makes the rational choice to put their trust in him, they can hold some of their more peripheral objections in tension until the day comes when they are resolved. In the meantime, they can still make the choice to believe—and ask God to help them with their unbelief.

### Concluding Quotes for consideration

- “One who claims to be a skeptic of one set of beliefs is actually a true believer in another set of beliefs.”  
	**Phillip E. Johnson**
- “People stumble over the truth from time to time, but most pick themselves up as if nothing happened.”  
	**Winston Churchill**
- “People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive.”  
	**Blaise Pascal**
- “Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.”  
	**Albert Einstein**

Nexus will explore the intersection of faith and reason, science and spirituality, logic and love.

Open mind? Open heart? Are reason and faith enemies or friends?
