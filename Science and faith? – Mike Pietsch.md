**(NOT EITHER / OR but BOTH / AND)**

## Background

### 1\. The initial unity of the religious and scientific worldviews

In the ancient world, right up until the Renaissance, all aspects of religion and science, wisdom and understanding were seen as having value and importance. Harold Nebelsick in his book “ *Circles of God: Theology and Science from the Greeks to Copernicus* ” summarises this period by saying that: ‘The motivating force behind the pursuit of natural theology \[the study of the natural world, i.e. science\] from the time of Babylon and Greece in the East to the time of the Renaissance in the West was theological rather than scientific.’ For example, astrology and astronomy were both seen to have validity in explaining the world as they knew it then, along with all of the other areas of learning (both ‘sacred’ and ‘secular’).

### 2\. Separation of science and theology

The separation of science and theology began at the start of the first universities in the 12th century with the division of learning into the various disciplines. Theology was seen as the primary discipline with the many other areas spinning off from this, including the natural sciences. Even though they had different areas of speciality, they were seen to be studying God’s world and universe from various perspectives.

Probably one of the first and most well-known occasions used to point to this division was Galileo’s assertion that rather than the sun revolving around the world, the world revolved around the sun. There are a number of incorrect myths about Galileo and the church at the time, which after the event have developed a life of their own and have only more recently been shown to be skewed or spurious. It is true that there were some people of the church (leaders and scholars) that reacted adversely to his suggestions, but he was equally opposed by scholars in his own discipline of the natural sciences. For example, it was only one scholar who refused to look through his telescope at the time. He was a fellow scientist, by contrast with the clerics who willingly looked through Galileo’s telescope. Equally, there were philosophers who refused to accept Galileo’s theories on the basis that they contradicted a number of the significant Greek philosophers, including Aristotle. So, the opposition was not only or primarily from ‘the church’.

Despite the differences emerging due to the differentiation of the various areas of study, Francis Bacon tried to weld theology and science together with his statement that theology is the ‘Book of God’s Word’ and that science is the ‘Book of God’s works’. Bacon warned that one should not unwisely mingle nor confound these learnings together. Despite this wisdom, Bacon’s definition of these two connected areas of study actually split the two disciplines (when taken in an extreme manner). This is a little bit in the same way as Luther’s doctrine of the two kingdoms (sacred and secular) was wrongly abused during the Nazi period. This division continued to grow for many scientists in particular, whereas theologians included science in the area of ‘general revelation’. The height of the division is heard in the writings of John William Draper who in his book ‘ *History of the conflict between Religion and Science* ’ (1875) wrote:

> Faith must render an account of herself to Reason. Mysteries must give place to facts. Religion must relinquish that…domineering position which she has so long maintained against Science … The ecclesiastic must learn to keep himself within the domain he has chosen, and cease to tyrannise over the \[natural\] philosopher, who, conscious of his own strength and purity of his motives, will bear such influence no longer …

Draper had many inaccurate differences and accounts of the ‘war’ between science and theology. These have been regurgitated again and again through the 20 <sup>th</sup> century, despite the fact that history of science scholars have shown that they are often inaccurate exaggerations or caricatures.

T.H.Huxley added to this division when he produced an atheist’s interpretation of Darwin’s theory, which spun a new philosophy known as ‘Darwinism’. Against Huxley’s interpretation of Darwin, Christians, who were scientists, and Christians in general rejected Darwinism, which then confused the issue of what Darwin had originally said and muddied the waters of this increasingly controversial and conflicted issue. This then moved into the even more polarised debate between the extremes of atheistic Darwinianism and the Creationists, epitomised in the Scopes trials of the early 20 <sup>th</sup> century in the United States.

### 3\. Science and faith re-converging

In the first half of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century, people such as Einstein continued to express a humble understanding of belief in a deity. Albert Einstein wrote: “I am not an atheist, and I don’t think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations.”

In the second half of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century the gap between science and faith has begun to be bridged in a number of ways.

1. The second half of the 20 <sup>th</sup>  century has seen the discovery of the increasing complexity of the universe both in its size and depth, along with our understanding of sub-atomic particles. This complexity and the issues of how such a universe could have evolved in such a relatively short time has led both scientists and philosophers such as Paul Davies to conclude that there is some sort of a ‘mind’ (of God) behind the laws and complexity and the development of the universe. Alternatively, it is posited that there would have to be thousands of parallel universes along-side our universe to increase the possibility of such complex life existing on earth. Anthony Flew had been an active and publicly vocal atheist almost his whole life as a philosophy university lecturer. His writings were used to powerfully support atheism in the second half of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century. But then Flew took more seriously the arguments for the existence of God along with the current scientific research which has been revealing the increasing complexity of the universe. This includes the biological evidence for the complexity of life which has been increasing exponentially in recent years. Add to the complexity calculated by physicists and mathematicians places the odds on it happening without some original order as almost totally remote. .
2. Related to this complexity is the principle known to physicists as the ‘Goldilocks principle’ which says that in order for life to have evolved on earth the environment would have had to have been so finely tuned in terms of the exact distance from the sun, the exact atmosphere and chemical possibilities, etc. Therefore, on the basis of this scientific data it seems there are factors which do not necessarily point specifically to a divine being, but at least hint in that direction and possibly make better sense of our universe if assumed.
3. The optimistic height at which science had been placed on a pedestal, and also the unrealistic expectations for its ability to transform ALL of society, has diminished in recent decades. It has been realised that science can be used for both good and evil and does not in itself have a moral compass. So the apparent advances that science offers are all too often monopolised by the strong minority, with the vast majority of humanity bearing the burden of missing out and suffering the consequent excesses of the powerful and immoral few. As Einstein has said: “Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.” Science does not have ALL the answers and cannot fully address all of the needs of the human condition in particular matters of ethics and values.
4. In recent decades, many prizes have been awarded to significant scholarship in the area of faith and science by the Templeton Foundation. This prestigious and wealthy organisation each year judges current scholarly attempts which look at the relationship of science and faith. It rewards these efforts with prizes worth millions of dollars to scholars who have shown unique and helpful research into the relationship between faith and science. These prizes are actually worth more money than the Nobel Prizes and are taking on a high profile. The Templeton Foundation has also funded the establishment of a number of research institutes including the Faraday institute at Cambridge University and the recently established Graeme Clarke Institute at Tabor College in Adelaide. The Graeme Clarke Institute website provides links to other similar organisations including the Centre for Theology and Natural Sciences, Berkley, California; ISCAST (The Institute for the Study of Christianity in an Age of Science and Technology) and St John’s College, Durham Uni, UK. Each of these institutions produces and publishes academic papers on a wide variety of topics related to the intersection of science and theology.
5. The recent rise of the (militant) neo-atheists has also lifted the profile and public discussion about the relationship between faith and science. In response to the anti-religious and atheistic publicity of people such as Dawkins and Hitchens, and others, many high profile scientists, who are also Christians, have entered the public discussion through debates, lectures and many books. These have included Francis Collins (international head of the Genome project), Donald McKay (brain scientist, physicist and logician), Owen Gingrich (Harvard Astronomer) and Alistair McGrath (formerly studied chemistry at Oxford in the area of molecular biophysics and now researches in the area of the History and Philosophy of Science).

#### Creative synergy between science and theology

These recent movements and facts have led scientists and theologians to take more seriously and humbly the possibility of realising that they might not have a complete view of the world within their own discipline alone, and that it could be more mature and beneficial to discover the world in a more comprehensive way by working together and respecting one another. Karl Popper reminds us all soberly that ultimate truth does not exist for human beings, but we move towards “greater verisimilitude”. Science and theology are not an ‘either/ or’ in this process of discovery but a ‘both/ and’. Both science and theology have their own working assumptions or axioms. They do however use different methodology to view the same universe. Their differing approaches and perspectives might be compared to different facets of the same diamond (the universe).

This impact of science on theology and theology on science can occur in three ways.

1. People who are scientists and also Christians/ theologians have their discoveries contextualised within the wider worldview of their faith. It can be quite liberating to see that their faith and scientific enterprise can co-exist and complement each other positively as well as in the dialectic that can arise.
2. Theologians who have either been scientists or who have also undertaken further study in matters of science can also have some of their narrow theological view of the world reshaped and enhanced by incorporating science within their theological framework.
3. Conferences in which both scientists and theologians can present and discuss their various ideas and so cross pollinate each other and gain deeper insights into life in the universe.

Albert Einstein emphases the need for both science and religion to work together with his pithy statement: “Science without religion is lame: religion without science is blind.” In these words, we hear that science has no moral or ethical backbone without religion. Science can be used to restore life as well as kill it. Religion calls science to account and points towards a moral use of its skills and powers. Equally, religion needs to have its eyes opened to the real world as evidenced by the logical engagement and measurement of the universe which dismisses naïve and shallow approaches to the lives of everyday people.

### Specific Issues of dialogue

#### Determinism and free-will

Some specific issues that can be considered from both angles are the relationship of determinism and free-will. These matters are of interest to both disciplines such as in science with Heisenberg’s randomisation of physics “uncertainty principle” and within theology the deterministic aspect with respect to salvation and original sin.

#### What is a human being?

Another issue that is being addressed by both science and theology is the question “What does it mean to be ‘human’?” or put more simply, “What is a human?” Professor Joel Green (Fuller University in the US) points out the many SciFi movies that attempt to explore this at the popular level. These include *Bicentennial Man, A.I.* and also *‘Lord of the Rings’* which has various levels of life along with the robot-like Orks. Professor Green has both academic degrees in theology and neuroscience. He points to the many questions related to that of determining when a person is conscious any more (with respect to end of life questions) along with numerous experiments to determine what is consciousness, both in animals, and humans. Are there any differences between humans and animals or are they just another level along the biological spectrum? What is the relationship between a human and a robot? And as we are approaching the time when so many body parts can be artificially inserted into us to keep us going, when does a human cease to be a human? What different brain functions occur when you examine the electrical responses in the brains of a meditating monk or Franciscan nun at prayer? Both talk therapy and drug therapy have been shown to change the ‘brain shape’. Recent research shows that humans don’t just come in biological ‘parts’, but that they are reshaped through their relationships, which can include their relationship with God. Our bodies are not just mechanical systems but dynamic and flexible. In the 1990s the very advanced robotic research programme at M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) employed a theologian as part of its staff in their thinking and research.

These are some of the emerging areas of productive overlap between science and theology which will find that working together rather than independently (or in opposition) might provide more in depth and comprehensive results due to collaboration.

### Appendix A

Some of the Biblical references that are cited both by theologians and scientists are the following:

- **Genesis 1:1, 2**

> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”

- **Psalm 8**

> Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!  
> You have set your glory above the heavens.  
> Through the praise of children and infants  
> you have established a stronghold against your enemies,  
> to silence the foe and the avenger.  
> When I consider your heavens,  
> the work of your fingers,  
> the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,  
> what are mere mortals that you are mindful of them,  
> human beings that you care for them?  
> You have made them a little lower than the heavenly beings  
> and crowned them with glory and honour.  
> You made them rulers over the works of your hands;  
> you put everything under their feet;  
> all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky,  
> and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.  
> Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.

- **John 10:10**

> “I have come that they might have life, and have it to the full.”

- **Acts 17: 24-28**

> “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man he made every nation of people, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that people would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. ‘For in him we move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’”

- **Colossians 1:15-20**

> “The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.”

- **Hebrews 1:1-4**

> “In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.”

### A sermon on Science and Faith

**(‘Reach’ service 6/9/2020)**

The Bible has two good news messages in it:

The **first** is that God created the world and the universe and everything in it;  
the **second** is that God loved the world so much, that even when it was in rebellion and failure mode, God came to rescue the world in the person of his Son Jesus Christ.

St Augustine called these two realities ‘ ***The Book of Nature*** ’ and ‘ ***The Book of Scripture*** ’. The Book of Scripture, or the Bible, primarily focusses on the loving rescue operation that God entered into through Abraham, Moses and all the prophets, culminating in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ for you and me.

We just heard about some of the ‘Book of nature’ in today’s Bible readings, but the ‘Book of Nature’ is mostly recorded and found in the natural world itself. When the current scientific era was beginning, Francis Bacon tried to weld theology and science together with his statement that **theology is the ‘Book of God’s Word’** and **science is the ‘Book of God’s works’**.

**Psalm 19** expresses it this way:

> ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of all the world.’

Seeing God in the world of nature is called **‘general’ revelation**. It does not detail God in specific ways, but non-verbally it points to the Creator who made it. We do not see God, but we see his footprints that point to the fact that he was here. This general revelation is complemented by **‘special’ revelation** which specifically speaks about who God is. We find ‘special’ revelation in the Bible, especially in the words of the prophets and in Jesus, who ultimately is ‘the Word’.

Both types of revelation point to God, but in different ways.

God is not part of the creation but is outside of his creation. God lovingly, creatively and imaginatively shapes the universe as a separate entity and places humans into the middle of it. Because God is outside of Creation, God is not the trees or waterfalls or animals or mountains. Some religions see nature itself as God or gods, and so they worship God as nature itself, not recognising God as the independent creator of nature. In these religions the venture of science has not had a starting point, because they believe that you should not try to study the mystery of the gods in the natural world. It is specifically in the Judeo-Christian faith that science has been able to begin and thrive. It is also where God gives humans the responsibility to take care and manage God’s created world. We become co-caretakers of the world with God. Therefore, we can objectively study, analyse and explore the world that God has made so that we might look after it all the better in partnership with him. Modern science began in particular in the monastic communities of the church, around the turn of the millennium. This is when the great universities of the world began in Bologna, Paris, Oxford and Cambridge.

Therefore, scientists explore the laws and workings of the world as part of their faith. Their privilege is to lift up the curtain of God’s creation, behind which is the knowledge about a universe that has form, order and explanations that are mathematical, logical and practical. The distinction between science and theology began at the start of the first universities in the 12th century with the division of learning into the various subject areas. Theology was seen as the primary discipline with the many other areas spinning off from this, including the natural sciences. However, even though they had different areas of speciality, they were all seen to be studying God’s world from various perspectives.

The second half of the 20 <sup>th</sup> century has seen the discovery of the increasing complexity of the universe including our discovery of cells and molecules, atoms and quarks. The complexity and the issues of how such a universe could have been created has led both scientists and cosmologists such as Paul Davies to conclude that there is some sort of a ‘mind’ (of God) behind the laws and the complexity of the universe.

Albert Einstein wrote:

> “We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn’t know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws but we only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations.”

Einstein’s humility at the wonder and mystery of the universe increasingly resonates with us today. But the arrogance of scientists such as Richard Dawkins has recently become quite muffled. Dawkin’s extreme views and opposition to God and faith have been exposed, and increasingly called into question. Over the last 150 years, the question of evolution has also been used as a ‘red herring’ to split apart science and faith. Evolution is addressed in a statement by the Lutheran Church in which it is not treated as a fact, but only a theory, and a theory that in itself is constantly changing. Evolution attempts to describe the “how?” of creation, not the “Who?” of the Creator who is described throughout the Bible.

We can support all scientists, especially those who are Christians, to explore the intricacies of God’s world. We can also question people who say that science and faith are opposed to each other. Science and faith are different, but they are complimentary and need to work together. The optimistic tall pedestal on which science has been offering hope for the last 200 years has fallen somewhat short in recent decades. The inability of science to transform ALL of society, is gradually being recognised. Science can be used for both good and evil and does not in itself have a moral compass. Science can make an atomic bomb to kill people, or a solar panel to generate electricity. The apparent advances that science offers are all too often monopolised by the strong wealthy few, while the vast majority of humanity miss out. As Einstein has said: “Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.” Science does not have ALL the answers and cannot fully address all of the needs of the human condition, in particular matters of ethics and values. Faith is called to be a guiding light for the good uses of scientific discovery. We not only need knowledge provided by science, but wisdom and love to know how to best use it. May God enable science and faith to work together for the good of God’s Kingdom.
