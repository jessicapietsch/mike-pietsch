**Sermon, Pentecost Sunday 21, 9 October 2016**

As you all know, my wife, Helen, and I have been through a tumultuous 18 months. After 9 of the 12 chemo sessions now completed, we are certainly in a far better place than when Helen spent 70 days in the Intensive Care Unit, a year ago. During that time we have faced life and death and healing and hope, as well as despair and pain. Along with our family and friends, you have all travelled this road with us. At the last session of chemo our oncologist genuinely seem puzzled and asked whether we had been doing something different, because Helen’s levels were better than he had expected. I did not think quickly enough at the time to respond to him with: ‘God knows’ or perhaps suggesting ‘many factors’.

In the meantime, I have been challenged by today’s readings to think about this whole matter of healing in the Biblical world and in our lives today in our 21 <sup>st</sup> century Western secular society.

Today, healing is still very much a significant part of our public discussion and personal lives. We dedicate a massive slice of our governments’ budget to health. And people personally pay the alternative health industry billions of dollars each year. Based on God’s Word, let us see what God has to say about our search for healing.

Our OT and Gospel texts for today speak about the healing of 11 lepers. One of them in 2 Kings 5 is the commander of the Syrian army who has leprosy. The other ten are a motley group of Jewish and Samaritan lepers whom Jesus meets outside the town gates, at a distance from normal life.

God heals them all in a number of ways. **Naaman** ’s journey to healing is also a discovery of humility. He is directed to the prophet in Israel by a little slave girl of his wife who had been captured by the Syrian forces when they were attacking their enemy, the Israelites. So Naaman has to go back to his enemy to request healing through the suggestion of an insignificant slave girl. When Naaman finally gets to the prophet Elisha, the prophet does not even come out to speak with Naaman personally after he had travelled such a long distance. Nor does Elisha perform any religious ritual or healing ceremony.

If this is not enough to make Naaman turn away from this so-called ‘healer’ Elisha, he is then directed by Elisha to wash in the tiny little muddy stream of the Jordan River with the expectation that this will heal him. This is the last straw for Naaman. He is heading back home, where there are at least beautifully large and clean rivers in which to wash. But Naaman’s servants manage to curb his arrogance and narrow-minded thinking, and they lead him down to the dirty Jordan River where after bathing seven times Naaman is totally healed. This foreigner from Syria comes back to the prophet with both a changed heart and thankfulness to the God of Israel.

Likewise, Jesus heals the **ten lepers** on their way to the town priests, who are the ones who inspect the skin to determine if they are healed. Heading off to the priests BEFORE they were healed would have taken a step of faith. They needed to assume that Jesus might heal them on the way. But again only one foreigner, a Samaritan, returns to thank the giver of his healing. It seems as if the other nine had just become all focused on their healing itself, rather than Jesus as the giver of the healing.

God uses all types of people in the healing process and goes beyond borders that we would not normally cross. Over the decades I have discovered that logical and scientific Western medicine does not have all the answers and that there is healing beyond the conventional. As with Western medicine, alternative medicine is also limited, but it has a degree of insight and wisdom discovered in God’s natural world. Ultimately I know that prayer is very much a part of healing, and it is very good to see that in our book of pastoral rites there is a **liturgy for healing** based on James 5:13-18. This begins with the premise that all healing begins with an openness and trust in God through the laying on of hands and anointing with oil.

But healing itself is not to be our primary focus. There are so many people who focus their whole life and expectations on being healed. I am not speaking about a strong desire to be healed or using all the resources at your disposal. I am speaking about an unhealthy focus on healing that does not ultimately place itself in God’s good care and timing. People try to force healing to occur in their own way and with their own expectations and almost demands. Naaman exhibited this with his expectations and narrow views on how and when and in what manned healing should occur.

Healing is not just a reactive matter, but also proactive. I watched a program on TV the other day, in which they have scientifically discovered that fasting is as important to growing and healing your body as is eating. When we are often told about the healthy Mediterranean diet, are we also told about how these people in Greece and Italy fast for up to 12 weeks of each year during Advent and Lent? The practice of fasting is something that the Western Protestant church has moved away from, which maybe science is helping us rediscover. Science and Western medicine is also pointing us to moderation and many other healthy ways of preventing illnesses, many of which are found in the Bible but which we have neglected.

Ultimately, we are called to be open to God working in our lives in his own way and in his good time and to do so with child-like dependence, trust and thanksgiving. This does not mean that it will be a smooth path. There are plenty of Psalms of anguish and cries to God that we may use along the way. But it does mean that underneath our desire and prayers for healing, there will be a quiet trust that we are in the hands of the ultimate healer. The word ‘salvation’ is connected to the word ‘’salve, which is a healing ointment. Jesus’ life is a healing ointment that we can apply to all parts of our life, knowing that God’s salvation is given to us in all aspects of our life including our physical health as well as our emotional, psychological and social.

In the end, our **final healing will come when we die**. We will all take to the grave our pain and illnesses, short and long-term, and in our death and resurrection into God’s eternity we will truly be healed forever. All the people who have been miraculously healed over the millennia, including the eleven lepers in our Bible lessons for today, eventually died. This is why Holy Communion is sometimes referred to as ‘the medicine of immortality’. In receiving Jesus in this special meal we are receiving someone who has not only healed others and been healed himself in his wounded and crucified body, but someone who has obtained for himself and all of us an eternal relationship with God beyond the grave.

Coming back to our oncologists’ question whether we are doing anything different that Helen’s levels are in a good direction, I could say that first we are trusting that God is behind the healing as expressed through our prayers and the prayers of many other people. Also love and care for Helen is a vital ingredient as well as the chemo and alternative health remedies that we are using. Helen has never wanted to hear from our oncologist any predictions of how long she might have to live. She is wise because ultimately as human beings we do not know. But we do know that we are alive today in God’s world and living in his presence, and will live with hope and thanksgiving each day that he gives us. Whether we are sick or well, this is how we should live each day of our lives.
