## The End of the World

### 1\. ‘Con-artists’

Yes, there are many ‘con-artists’ when it comes to this emotive and fearful issue of the ‘ **end of the world** ’ and/ or ‘ **judgement day** ’.

1. Some people are most genuine and intense about the end of the world and the second-coming of Christ, but they are duped and / or dupe others. One example of this would be the Jehovah’s Witnesses who have prophesied the end of the world on about seven different occasions during the 19 <sup>th</sup>  and 20 <sup>th</sup> centuries, none of which have been able to genuinely show that Christ has returned. They say that the supposed ‘return of Christ’ in about 1914 was done in a hidden manner.
2. Clever or insightful and / or manipulative people who know how to read the ‘signs of the times’ also know how to read the fears and concerns of the average human being. Nostradamus would fall into this category. These people know how to bend and shape words and situations to their own ends and purposes. They are able to keep things vague enough, but also fearful enough to attract an audience. They are also interpreted by clever and manipulative people who take advantage of the insecurity and fear in people.

Examples from the prophesies are as follows taken from these are from the book ***Nostradamus**,* by Francis X King, 1993 :

#### Intro re the predictions for the last 10 years (after the time of printing: 1993):

- ‘Prediction’ of the change of calendar several years after the death of Nostradamus (pp 14, 15)
- Prediction of Hitler (p 15 and p 59)
- Would the black or white pig of the nobleman be eaten? (p 21)
- Conjunction in Pisces—a major naval conflict in 1966? (p 71)
- Supposed prophesies of the Nazi propaganda machine forged by the Nazis (p 76)
- End of the Papacy (pp 82,83)
- Poisoning of New York—Three Mile Island (pp 100, 101)
- Olympic Games/ Games of Death (pp 106, 107)
- Chemical Warfare 1999 (pp110, 111)
- Doomsters and Prophets (p 122)
- Specific dates: Fire of London 1666, coming of the ‘King of Terror’ 1999, (p 128)
- Misses/ lapses 1700 prophesied but no significant events occurred in this year (p 142)
- Date for the end of the world: 3797 AD (p 169)!!!!
- Turn of the century hysteria 999 AD 999 (p169)

The M **ayan calendar** says that the end of the world will occur on 20/12/2012, but this obviously did not happen. People are now saying that this might have to be changed due to some miscalculations within the Mayan system, so we will wait for the revised date.

1. Naïve Christians who have an excessive pre-occupation with ‘the end of the world’. They read so many of the Biblical ‘predictions’ into numerous situations that are occurring on the world stage of history today or in the near future. This would include the Christadelphians, some tele-evangelists and some Seventh Day Adventists, along with other denominations and charismatic individuals (as well as the proverbial street-corner preachers who specialise in ‘hell-fire and brimstone’).
2. Some or all of the above combined in various ways to suit the ‘audience’.

#### Dangers of these approaches:

The focus is often on fear as the motivator. Fear itself is then used to frighten and persuade people, even for ‘good’ reasons, such as forcing them to become part of a particular church or sect or even to force them to ‘accept’ the Gospel. This then distorts and overshadows the message of Christ and the Good News of love, forgiveness, life and the Kingdom of God…both now and in the future.

### 2\. A balanced approach towards ‘the end of everything’.

(a) Everything does and will end at some time. It leads ‘The Preacher’ (**Ecclesiastes**) to say “ *For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come, both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!*”

Life is a series of births and deaths of:

- Ideas
- People, animals and plants
- Buildings, cities, cultures (e.g. Jesus’ prophesy of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem: Mark 13)
- Relationships, experiences, events

So, pragmatically we know that the many good and bad things we experience will end, and we also have a **‘use-by’ date** and we will ultimately personally ‘end’ at our own death.

This terminal nature of the world and its instability is amplified by events like:

War, famine, tidal waves, earthquakes, car accidents, deaths of people close to us, loss of goods that are valuable to us, etc. Jesus reminds us of these realities and the temporary nature of life in the ‘Little Apocalpse’ in Mark chapter 13 (and also parallels in Matthew 24 and Luke 21:5-36).

These **realities of impermanence** and our eventual demise remind us that one day we will be facing God in our nakedness; nakedness as on the day that we were born.

### 3\. How do we respond to these ‘ends’?

1. **Ignore them.**  
	We just enjoy the good while it lasts and avoid the losses. As they say ‘Shit happens’.
2. **Attempt to alleviate**  
	the bad and prolong the good, either selfishly for myself or by attempting to do this unselfishly for the wider good of the community (which can often be either frustrating or depressing).
3. **Avoid thinking about the fact**  
	that I am going to die and set up all sorts of other goals which are achievable and so convince myself that at least some things in life I can control and they are not terminal (at least not in the short term). The pyramids and buildings of long-lasting marble are examples of this idea of achieving ‘immortality’ and beating the transitional nature of life. Also The Preacher in the book of Ecclesiastes’ creates buildings and likewise cultural items (Eccles 2:4-11). Artwork can also be used as a futile attempt to create permanence.
4. **Join a religion**  
	which lets me know when the end of the world is about to come (or at least a good idea of when it is about to come) and have all the information about what I need to do before then (eg storing up enough food in my pantry to be able to feed my family when the initial onslaught of the ‘end of the world’ comes or the millennium arrives or the ‘second-coming of Christ’ occurs).

### 4\. What has God done about the terminal nature of the world?

God has taken on being a terminal human being himself in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, and in this person, God has been terminated or killed. However, he has returned from this termination (death) to let us know that the termination of humans need not be ‘the end’ and that there is a great future beyond death for all who rest in his grace, forgiveness, love and power.

As his brand-new people we are now offered eternal life which begins ‘today’ as we live with the grace and the ease of knowing that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, the love of the Father, nor the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. So, there is no longer anything left to fear. Therefore, any scare-mongering by people with respect to the ‘end of the world’ becomes irrelevant to the child of God who is securely ensconced in the grace of the Kingdom of God. (Romans 8:18-39)

Additionally, God has a sense of purpose and direction with respect to both his creation and his people. He does not want to see them stuck on the treadmill of termination and an endless cyclic process (such as reincarnation). Rather, God has not only placed us in time, but has said that there will be an end to these ‘ends’. In other words, he has promised that one day this whole creaking and groaning world with all of its decay and problems and endings will finally come to a final end and God himself will be there to embrace us with a new heaven and a ‘new earth’ (Revelation 21:1ff).

This is how he refers to the second time that Christ will come to our world, not this time as a baby in a manger but with all of his cosmological glory along with his compassion and his very own damaged humanity (Rev 5:6-14). The exact nature of this ‘Second Coming’ is depicted using various imagery in the New Testament (and Old). His first coming as a baby and crucified criminal is part of the kaleidoscope of his second coming in glory.

### 5\. Some Biblical attempts to predict the end of the world

Some of this future imagery is conveyed in descriptions such as:

- The ‘seven signs’ of Christ’s return (as anticipated by some)
- Restoration of Israel
- Europe united
- The Anti-Christ
- A New world-wide religion
- The rebuilding of the temple
- Invasion of Israel from the north
- Battle of Armageddon

Additional ‘signs’:

- Gospel preached in all the world
- Wars and rumours of wars
- False Christs and prophets
- Tribulations and trials
- Sun and moon darkened and falling of stars
- The great ‘falling away’
- Distress among the nations
- Fall of ‘Babylon’Number of the ‘beast’ 666
- Satan bound and loosed (The Millenium)
- Seven plagues and three woes

### 6\. How different to our expectations will the end and heaven be?

For the people of the Old Testament, what occurs in the New Testament is totally unexpected and unusual if not even confronting (e.g. the crucifixion). God had sent them the prophets with their prophesies but they still did not anticipate the manner in which the Kingdom of God was going to be ushered in, let alone the radically different life style it was going to affirm (loving your enemies!!!). Will it not possibly be the same for us in the New Testament anticipating the end of the world and the NEW heavens and earth. We have glimpses and insights, but the reality I am sure will be far more than we can believe or cope with.

**C.S.Lewis** puts in this way addressing people who scoff at the childish pictures of heaven that are circulated:

> “There is no need to be worried by facetious people who try to make the Christian hope of ‘Heaven’ ridiculous by saying they don’t want ‘to spend eternity playing harps.’ The answer to such people is that if they cannot understand books written for grown-ups, they should not talk about them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are mentioned because for most people (not all) music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with God in eternity share his splendour and power and joy. Gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of Heaven (gold does not rust ) and the preciousness of it. People who take these symbols literally might as well think that when Christ told us to be like doves, he meant that we were to lay eggs!”

### 7\. Our human attempts to control and predict the future

Our ‘ **original sin** ’ (or ‘human condition’) is that we as humans want to have our own lives and future in our control and so these attempts to predict the future are perfect examples of our manipulative nature, our human condition from which Jesus is trying to free us. Hence, when he was here on earth as one of us, he said ‘ *no one knows the day or the hour of the end, NOT EVEN THE SON OF MAN* ’ (Mk 13:32, referring to himself).

To not know the future and to trust in God’s future is what it means to be fully human, as we were originally created to be. Jesus warns us to be wise and cautious, letting us know that the end of the world will come. But TODAY is the day of salvation and everyday we need to die to our selves and live anew in the Kingdom of God. That begins here and now and lasts forever, through the ‘end of the world’ and the second coming and on into eternity with God. We are to live lives that are totally dependent on the love and grace of God, reliant and trusting that he will be with us no matter what may occur. We are called to live as though Jesus died yesterday, rose from the dead this morning and will return tomorrow. We live totally surrounded by the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. So when he returns we will be with him ALREADY. ETERNITY BEGINS TODAY.

When **Martin Luther** was asked what he would do if he knew that the world was going to end tomorrow, he said: ‘ *I would plant an apple tree.*’ He knew that fear tactics had rarely ever engendered any genuine response of faith. He well remembered his fearful promise that he made to become a priest. He made this in the face of the terrifying thunder storm that he encountered. By contrast, Luther discovered and finally trusted in Christ’s message of grace. He was then fully prepared and ready to die, or prepared to receive Christ whenever he returned at the second coming.

## Sermon: Are we living in the last days?

**Sermon 4/10/2020  
****(Bible readings: Matthew 13:21-37; Romans 8:22-28, 38, 39)**

There has always been a small minority of people in every generation who focus on the “end of the world”. They come up with all sorts of theories and predictions, mostly scary ones trying to get people to listen to their message.

But during 2020, especially along with **Covid-19**, there have been more and more mainstream people talking about ‘the end times’, at least the end for human beings.

There has been a number of realities that have fed into this serious conversation. These include the **Covid pandemic** which is not an isolated event, but one that is very difficult to contain, and it is found all over the world. It is being graphically referred to as “The plague”. It brings death and panic as well as isolation and fear.

Then there is all of the news about the **extinction** of so many animals and insects throughout the world. This is compounded by the reduction of natural and wild land areas for animal life, decimated by logging, out of control fires or just ‘progress’. And not only are animals being threatened, there is the increasing talk about the creation of **Artificial Intelligence** machines such as robots (or “bots” as they are now being called). Some predict that robots are well on the way to taking over many areas of human activity, if not eventually all. If humans exist in the future, we will just become the slaves of the robots. Already these bots are found in the workplace and our homes, as well in our personal lives, and even inside of us, as prosthetic parts in our bodies, such as pacemakers.

Add to all this the wildfires around the world and other **natural disasters** that are featured so widely through our media. These have a surreal, apocalyptic feel of what the end of the world might look like. Along with this are the large political and racial protests that are occurring in many countries, including places that were previously seen to be civil and safe environments, governed by the rule of law and the police force. So how do we cope with all of this? Do we just shut it out, or accept it as the ‘new norm’? How are our children and grandchildren affected by it? Where does God fit into all of this increased chaos and predictions about ‘the end of the world’?

In **Luke 17:20 Jesus was asked by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God would come**. Jesus replied: ‘ *The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say ‘Here it is’ or ‘There it is’, because the kingdom of God is in your midst (or within you).*’

Up until the time of Jesus the people were anticipating the future coming of God’s Kingdom when he would rescue them and rule over them in a wonderful and new way. Here Jesus is saying that the Kingdom of God HAS arrived: ‘the Kingdom of God is in your midst, or as some translators render it: ‘the kingdom of God is among you’.

We can **think of this kingdom of God in three ways**:

— The kingdom is present in the person of Jesus;  
— or the new community of God is to be found in the new relationships as established by Jesus;  
— or we can take St Paul’s understanding saying that the Kingdom of God is personally inside of us and our body is a temple of Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

In fact, we can say that all of these three realities are true. They all came to us in our baptism when we were joined with Jesus on the cross and received into the loving community of God’s church and filled with the Holy Spirit. So now this gives us a whole different perspective on the end of the world and encountering the judgement of God at the last day at the end of time.

Paul expresses it by saying that there is now nothing that can separate us from the love of God. So, whether the end of the world comes tomorrow, next year or near the end of our lives, or if we die before the world ends, we know that we are safe in the arms of our loving Lord Jesus Christ. We have his fullness and life, his forgiveness and peace and freedom from any fear.

So, we are given a totally new way of looking at the world, including its end, and our end.

**Dietrich Bonhoeffer** explains how he understands this, writing from prison in Berlin where he spent two years:

> ‘There remains for us only the very narrow way, often extremely difficult to find, of living every day as if it were our last, and yet living in faith and responsibility as though there were to be a great future…Thinking and acting for the sake of the coming generation, but being ready to go any day without fear or anxiety.’

Bonhoeffer invites us to hold in tension two things: On the one hand, living life today as if it is our **last day here on earth**: and on the other hand to live today with the confidence that God is creating an **amazing future in our life** in the world now, and also in heaven for eternity.

Holding these two realities in tension and giving equal weight to both creates peace in our hearts because we know that we are utterly surrounded by God, no matter what. No disaster in this world can come between us and our heavenly Father. Jesus provides a bridge over every horrific chasm, he battles every frightening beast, he stands by our side through thick and thin.

So, the options for us as we think about our future are as follows:

— If today is our last day on earth and we are hit by a bus this afternoon, we have the promise of Jesus from the cross that ‘Today you will be with me in paradise’.

— If Jesus returns to the earth in the second coming at the end of this week, we know that we are in good hands and we can welcome him.

— If we live another 20 or 100 years of our life on this earth, and the end of the world has not come yet, nor Jesus returned, we can rest in God’s grace that reminds us that even though we walk through the shadow of death, our loving shepherd will be there for us, and our risen Lord will direct us to the heavenly mansion that he is preparing for us.

— If before that time we go through illness or persecution for our faith, or see the world as we know it crumbling around us, we know that our Lord has invited to suffer with him as he has suffered with us, and that this is just a temporary event in the grand scheme in which God is ultimately in control.

And when we finally stand before our God and judge, we will stand there with Jesus Christ covering us with his love and forgiveness. Therefore, if we are now living in the last days, we are living in them with the God of the universe who is the God of eternity and who wants us to live with his for all eternity. So we can be peaceful and calm and trust and know that nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And when other people around us are anxious or panicking, we can share with them where our confidence, peace and hope come from in the face of every adversity. And today in the bread and wine, the body and blood of Jesus, we are assured that nothing will ever separate us from God, ever.
