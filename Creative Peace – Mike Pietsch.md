There are many ways in which as ethical and religious people we can agree that we should be striving for peace. These would include the following reasons:

1. Every human is made in the image of God and so should be respected.
2. Most religions call on their adherents to love their neighbour as they love themselves. This is very conducive to a peaceful community.
3. Peace and stability are fundamental needs of all communities which enable them to operate most efficiently and safely. This includes the peace provided by the state such as the ‘Pax Romana’, various ‘Peace Accords’ between nations along with military ‘Peace Keepers’. At the local level it is connected with the phrase ‘keeping the peace’ and the ‘Justice of the Peace’ (or JP as we abbreviate it).
4. At base, as a selfish motive, peace is conducive to the continuation of the human race and makes sure that we do not wipe out the human race through excessive use of force and fighting.

However, rather than just re-affirm these factors (which obviously I am more than happy to do) I shall attempt to convey what for me is the most important essence of peace which is the foundation of the ‘good news’ of Jesus Christ. This essence is the basis of the Christian faith as I understand it, and I hope it will provide a foundational depth as to what peace can mean.

For a Christian, peace is not something for which we strive, but something that has already been won in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are then invited to receive this amazing gift of peace which Jesus offers to us. In the death of Jesus, we can triumphantly proclaim that God has made peace with all of humanity and has also invited all of us to be embraced by this peace and in so doing embrace each other with this same peace.

Now this is where the rubber really hits the road, because prior to God embracing us with the newly-won peace of Jesus, humans were the enemy of God and vice versa. There was a brokenness between us and God. Rather than waiting for us to come back to him (as we should have because we were the cause of the broken relationship according to Genesis 2 and 3), God comes to us and is prepared to allow himself to be crucified by us in order for the relationship to be restored. He is prepared to lose out and dishonour himself by living a vulnerable life in which he is eventually killed.

In approaching humans he is approaching ‘the enemy’. He then lovingly embraces the enemy (humanity) which when once recognised, crucifies Jesus (God). But ultimately love conquers all, and Jesus is raised from the dead and calls all of his followers to ‘love your enemy’ (Matthew 5:43-47).

Here Jesus says

> ‘You have heard that it was said: ‘Love your neighbour and hate your enemy’. But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?’

So if two people are to be reconciled they first need to re-discover the fact that God has already made peace with each of them so that they in turn can now live in that peace of God as well. This is the greatest miracle that the world will ever see, whether it is between two friends or two family members or a husband and wife or between literal enemies (as happened briefly on Christmas Day during World War I).

It is also what happened after WWII had ended, when **Corrie Ten Boon** met a Gestapo prison guard who had been in her Nazi Prisoner of War camp. She met him immediately after she had just been preaching about love and forgiveness at a Christian meeting. Now came the real test after the lecture. This former Nazi guard approached Corrie with his outstretched hand. Initially she could not physically raise her hand to greet him at all. But when she asked Jesus to lift it up for her she found that she could lovingly reach out her hand in order to shake his hand, despite all of the terrible ways that he had treated her, her sister and others in the Nazi camp.

I would like to make this more personal and close to each one of us by exploring this within the context of a marriage relationship as one place in which we need to and can make peace and live peaceably..

### The servanthood model of marriage

This model essentially comes out of the statement by Paul who said in reference to marriage in Ephesians 5:21: ‘Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.’ This is said to both husbands and wives and I believe springs from the wider and deeper understanding of human relationships which Jesus presented for all human beings. Paul’s explanation of this submission is then further defined in Ephesians 5:22ff. This radical statement that husbands are to submit to their wives and wives are to submit to their husbands, comes out of the new way in which God in Christ relates to all his children. Paul also speaks about this mutuality in 1 Corinthians 7:3-5.

The following give three models of marriage:

**1\. Traditional:**

God  
|  
husband  
|  
wife

**2\. Humanistic ‘liberation’:**

Power and decision-making is 50 % /50 %

husband (partner) & wife (partner)

**3\. Servants of one another:**

100% / 100% servants of one another because of Jesus

husband & wife

(served by Christ and his wife) oo (served by Christ and her husband)

serves (and submits oo serves (and submits  
to) his wife to) her husband

Jesus (the ultimate servant)  
serves both wife and husband

This third model (the servant model) is most fully informed by the ways in which Jesus described and lived the Kingdom of God. With the coming of the Kingdom of God in Jesus, a new and radical depth is given to the relationship between God and his people. Some of these radical aspects are found in the fact that God himself became a human being. Not only that, but God allowed human beings to kill him in an effort to get rid of this radical new ‘prophet’ or ‘teacher’ who was both calling them to account and repentance as well as a deeper lifestyle of love and service. Humble incarnation and voluntary death are the main two extremities of the depth that Jesus was ushering in through the Kingdom of God and are expressed profoundly in the Christ hymn of Philip 2:5-11, in which the attitude of the Christian is to be one of humility, submission and sacrifice.

On several occasions Jesus also put human relationships into quite a different perspective. He said that the primary relationship a person now had was to God and to himself. The human relationships of father, mother, brother, sister, wife, husband, servant/ master, Jew/ Gentile (nationality and religion), male/ female (sexuality), even teacher/ pupil, clean/ unclean, etc were all of a secondary nature to our relationship to God and the new community of human beings that he was creating. Thus these secondary relationships were always subservient (or secondary) to our relationship with God and our new brothers and sisters that we discover in the family of God, the body of Christ, the church which is always open to everyone, as Jesus was.

The new ways of the Kingdom are clearly spelled out by Jesus in both his teaching and actions. Just prior to instituting the Lord’s Supper, Jesus washes the disciples’ feet (John 13:3-17), and then during the Lord’s Supper, Jesus scolds the disciples for trying to take the worldly response of leadership and domination (Luke 22:24-30). By contrast they are to be servants of one another. His own life and action demonstrate the life of a humble servant, who gave up his power and authority to show that as humans there is a new framework for mending relations and then living together. Jesus is called the ultimate of servants which he expressed by giving up everything out of love for all people (Mark 10:45). Jesus evens talk about himself continuing to serve us even at his second coming (Luke 12:37).

Therefore, when we consider these human relationships, we are not to reject them in themselves, but to live in them in the new way of the Kingdom of God. One example is that of the master (Philemon) and slave (Onesimus) whom Paul asks that each treat each other first and foremost as brothers in Christ, placing into a secondary position their slave/ master relationship. In verses 15 and 16 Paul exhorts Philemon saying: ‘Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother’. The new relationship with Christ provides a new and deeper basis in which to live in human relationship, be it slave and master or husband and wife.

### Conclusion:

This example of a servant relationship in marriage can be applied to many other areas of human life and relationships. If it was practised at all of these personal levels between people, it may also have a greater impact on the more macro-relationships within and between societies. This is not ‘pie-in-the-sky’ beliefs and life-style**,** but has a proven track-record.
