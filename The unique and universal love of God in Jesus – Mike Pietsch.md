### (1) Bono on Karma and Grace

Interview with **Paul David Hewson**, KBE (born 10 May 1960), most commonly known by his stage name  [**Bono**](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015160055/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono), is an Irish singer and musician, best known for being the main vocalist of the Dublin-based rock band U2.

**Interviewer (Assayas):  
**I think I am beginning to understand religion because I have started acting and thinking like a father. What do you make of that?

**Bono:**  
Yes, I think that’s normal. It’s a mind-blowing concept that the God who created the universe might be looking for company, a real relationship with people, but the thing that keeps me on my knees is the difference between Grace and Karma.

**Interviewer:  
**I haven’t heard you talk about that.

**Bono**:  
I really believe that we have moved out of the realm of Karma into one of Grace.

**Interviewer:  
**Well, that doesn’t make it clearer for me.

**Bono:  
**You see, at the centre of all religions is the idea of Karma. You know, what you put out comes back to you: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, or in physics – in physical laws – every action is met by an equal or an opposite one. It’s clear to me that Karma is at the very heart of the universe. I’m absolutely sure of it. And yet, along comes this idea called Grace to upend all that “as you reap, so you will sow” stuff. Grace defies reason and logic. Love interrupts, if you like, the consequences of your actions, which in my case is very good news indeed, because I’ve done a lot of stupid stuff.

**Interviewer:**  
I’d be interested to hear that.

**Bono:**  
That’s between me and God. But I’d be in big trouble if Karma was going to finally be my judge. I’d be in deep s—. It doesn’t excuse my mistakes, but I am holding out for Grace. I’m holding out that Jesus took my sins onto the Cross, because I know who I am, and I hope I don’t have to depend on my own religiosity.

**Interviewer:  
**The Son of God who takes away the sin of the world. I wish I could believe in that.

**Bono:  
**But I love the idea of the Sacrificial Lamb. I love the idea that God says *Look, you cretins, there are certain results to the way we are, to selfishness, and there’s a mortality as part of your very sinful nature, and, let’s face it, you’re not living a very good life, are you? There are consequences to actions.* The point of the death of Christ is that Christ took on the sins of the world, so that what we put out did not come back to us, and that our sinful nature does not reap the obvious death. That’s the point. It should keep us humbled … It’s not our own good works that get us through the gates of heaven.

**Interviewer:  
**That’s a great idea, no denying it. Such great hope is wonderful, even though it is close to lunacy, in my view. Christ has his rank among the world’s great thinkers. But Son of God, isn’t that farfetched?

**Bono:  
**No, it’s not farfetched to me. Look, the secular response to the Christ story always goes like this: he was a great prophet, obviously a very interesting guy, had a lot to say along the lines of other great prophets, be they Elijah, Muhammad, Buddha, or Confucius.  
But actually Christ doesn’t allow you that. He doesn’t let you off that hook. Christ says: *No. I’m not saying I’m a teacher, don’t call me teacher. I’m not saying I’m a prophet. I’m saying: “I’m the Messiah.” I’m saying: I am God incarnate.”* And people say *No, no, please, just be a prophet. A prophet, we can take. You’re a bit eccentric. We’ve had John the Baptist eating locusts and wild honey, we can handle that. But don’t mention the “M” word! Because, you know, we’re gonna have to crucify you.* And he goes: *No, no. I know you’re expecting me to come back with an army, and set you free from these creeps \[the Romans\], but actually I am the Messiah.  
*At this point, everyone starts staring at their shoes, and says: *Oh, my God, he’s gonna keep saying this.* So what you’re left with is: either Christ was who He said He was – the Messiah – or a complete nutcase.  
I mean, we’re talking nutcase on the level of Charles Manson. This man was like some of the people we’ve been talking about earlier. This man was strapping himself to a bomb, and had “King of the Jews” on his head, and, as they were putting him up on the Cross, was going: *OK, martyrdom, here we go. Bring on the pain! I can take it.* I’m not joking here. The idea that the entire course of civilization for over half of the globe could have its fate changed and turned upside-down by a nutcase, for me, *that’s* farfetched …

\[Bono later says it all comes down to how we regard Jesus\]

**Bono:**  
…\[I\]f only we could be a bit more like Him, the world would be transformed … When I look at the Cross of Christ, what I see up there is all my s… — and everybody else’s. So I ask myself a question a lot of people have asked: Who is this man? And was He who He said He was, or was He just a religious nut? And there it is, and that’s the question. And no one can talk you into it or out of it.

**(2) The Gospel of God’s love, passion and compassion is for all people**

1. Jesus Christ loves people unconditionally no matter how much their life-style is different, strange or seemingly ‘twisted’. (Rom 5:6)
1. God in Christ invites every person in the world to have intimate and immediate access to God. This means that no one should use any form of power (including political, religious, personal) to exclude people or communities from this direct access to a loving, personal and intimate God. God is not coercive and doesn’t use power to compel us against our will. God’s nature is love, humility, respect, patience, vulnerability and care. (cf the Christ hymn of Philippians 2:5-11). As Carl Jung reminds us: “Jesus’ religion of love was the exact psychological counterpoint to the politics of power. Jesus pointed humanity to the truth that where force rules there is no love, and where love reigns force does not count.”
1. There should be no conditions of any sort placed on anybody’s access to the love of God, which is freely offered through the loving life, death and resurrection of Jesus as an unconditional gift to **every** person.
2. The acknowledgment of being embraced by this overwhelming love of God remains open throughout a person’s life, even when a person rejects or is inattentive to this gift of gracious access to God (through ignorance or active opposition). Jesus, however, reminds us that a person’s anticipated ‘tomorrow’ may not be available to them, and God is seeking intimacy with all people, ‘today’. (Cf The rich farmer who keeps expanding his barns Luke 12:13ff and Lazarus and the Rich man Luke 16:19ff.)
3. Along with God unconditionally accepting all people, so also the Kingdom of God, as embodied in the world by the church, can never turn away any person who receives and desires to celebrate with them the gracious God who calls all people to be saved and to be a part of this new loving community.
4. No church or human being can usurp God’s role and say whether any particular individual is part of God’s kingdom, either now or in eternity. An attempt to draw a line around the kingdom of God can be part of a religious power game to control people and their lives.
5. No church or religious group is to use their beliefs to draw people away from God’s good creation or deny people access to the material needs of life. If people voluntarily give up material possessions it should not be seen as a means of granting access to God, but as a way of sharing more widely and fairly the abundant goods of God’s world.
6. No one should describe God *primarily* as an almighty judge who essentially calls people to give account of their actions. In presenting God in this way they may limit the person’s ability to hear and experience the grace of God. The grace of God is always ‘centre stage’ with our human limitations only being the ‘back drop’.

**(3) The Gospel is uniquely liberating and personal.**

**Christ does not employ power structures or fear as a method to control people.**

1. The church should apologise for its past intolerance of people of other cultures and religions. In a number of situations this has been done personally and corporately. However, in its apology, the church should not lose sight of its task of proclaiming the light and essence of God’s grace. In order for the church to authentically proclaim this Gospel of grace, the church should illuminate both the ‘light’ of God’s grace and the ‘dehumanising darkness’ when grace and mercy are denied to people. This is to be done openly and respectfully, but without apology, both inside the institutionalised church and throughout the world. It needs to be expressed to individuals (as well as to institutions and belief structures) which by means of their beliefs or practices deny life and liberation to people.
2. Beliefs and practices, which deny personal and life-giving access to God and the Kingdom of God, are to be condemned and exposed. Such debilitating beliefs and practices occur when, for example, only the following groups of people are accepted as the people of God:
1. 1. only certain people of a specific ethnic or racial extraction
	2. only males or only females
	3. only adults or people of a certain age
	4. only those whose beliefs conform in a specific way
	5. only those who have fulfilled certain religious tasks, rituals, religious expectations
	6. only those who have fulfilled certain moral or ethical criteria
	7. only those who have a certain standing in the community or belong to any particular religious family
	8. only those who have formal membership of a particular religion (including Christianity) or particular denomination/religious grouping
	9. only those who adhere to western familial structures as embodied by the ‘nuclear family’
	10. only those who have attended Sunday school and/or church services somewhat regularly in the past 12 months
	11. only those with a certain degree of theological knowledge (Cf Matt 20:1-16).
1. People have the freedom to deny God’s existence and to live their lives without God or the Gospel. They are to be loved as a person even though their belief position may differ from others.
2. Even though God is compassionate and gracious, he does not deal with evil by ‘turning a blind eye’ to it. Christ, through his death, takes on the consequences which should be ours when we have consciously or unconsciously hurt other people around us. Apology and restitution are to be attempted, but within our fallible world full restitution (without grace) is impossible once the negative action has been completed.
3. Forgiveness and moving on into a renewed relationship is not just a matter of getting things ‘fair and square’. We are not to primarily live by rules, regulations and what we consider to be ‘fair’. If we attempt to do so we will inevitably either live under a cloud of depression for not being able to make full restitution, or develop a sense of pride that we have lived up to what is expected and have perhaps even some ‘credit’ owing to us. There are still consequences for actions in our world – it’s just that in Christ we have the promise that these consequences don’t define us (I am not the sum of the actions of my life) and don’t echo into eternity.  
	Living with a ‘credit rating’ in our compassionate and fair ‘bank account’, we may end up seeing ourselves as better than others and develop an attitude that places others ‘below us’. Related to this is the question as to who has the right, let alone the ability, to count and weigh what we ‘owe’ or are ‘owed’?
4. This also raises the question of motivation, ‘To what extent do we do the good that we may do for the benefit of the other person; or to what extent is it for our own credit (or paying off debit) in our compassionate and fair ‘bank account’?’ Are we motivated to be a caring neighbour to others, at least in part, because we will gain credits for our own religious or ethical ‘bank account’?
5. Ultimately, Christ has taken on the balancing of our credit and debit rating liberating us from this responsibility, allowing us to live freely by God’s grace alone. But it is far more than just ‘balancing the accounts’. He has lavished us with more ‘credit’ (love) than we need so that it is enough for all eternity. We are free to live in a new relationship unfettered by a framework of rewards and punishments and fears of doing wrong or attempting to do the right. This new life is nothing that we can manufacture, create or earn but simply receive, enjoy and share. It is a life of living, receiving and giving love.
1. This new life grows and matures when we allow Christ to live through us. “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Galatians 2:20). This new life grows out of our daily relationship with Jesus with whom each day we die and rise again to live in and through him (Romans 6:1-14).

**(4) The paradox of the Gospel and life.**

There are Bible passages, which if taken in isolation can support an ‘ ***inclusive*** ’ position or an ‘ ***exclusive*** ’ position with regard to the Gospel and all people. Rather than selecting the passages which suit our particular ‘brand’ of Christianity (which swings to either inclusivity or exclusivity), we may need to hear the paradoxical message which says that it is not a matter of ‘either/or’, but ‘both/and’. Both inclusivity and exclusivity need to be equally emphasised.

**Passages which support the *inclusive* message of the Gospel are the following:**

Genesis 12:1-3; Ps 86:9; I Kings 8:41-43; Isaiah 2:1-3; 19:19-25; 40:5; 56:3-8; 60:1-16; 65:1; 66:19-24; Ezekiel 47:21-23; Micah 4:1-5; Zechariah 2:10-13; 8:20-23; Matthew 11:21-23; 12:18-21; Mark 9:38-41; 11:17; Luke 3:6; John 12:32; Acts 2:21,38,39; 10:34,35; Romans 2:1-16; 11:25-32; 1Corinthians 15:20-22; Philippians 2:9-11; I Tim 4:10.

**Passages which speak of the *exclusive* message of the Gospel include:**

Genesis 12:2,3; Exodus 20:1-6; Deuteronomy 6:4; Psalms 86:8-10; 96; 97:6-9; Matthew 10:32-39; 12:30-32; 16:13-19; John 3:17,18, 36; 4:42; 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:21-30; 11:25-32;

I Cor. 3:11; Galatians 5:16-21; Ephesians 2:8,9;

1Thessalonians 1:9-10; I John 4:13-16; 5:11-12; Revelation 20:11-21:8.

Many people believe that life is based on paradoxical realities, whether these are the paradoxes of servant/lord, saint/sinner, human/divine, eternity/the present, free-will/ determinism. If we emphasise one side of the paradox to the detriment of the other we get a distorted picture. It is only by holding both in tension that a realistic and Gospel centred response can be given.

**(5) Guidelines for Christians relating to other religions:**

1. Fully accept and affirm the other person as a fellow human being who has strengths as well as weaknesses.
2. Listen to and hear what the other person is saying about their faith. “Walk a mile in their shoes.”
3. Affirm and appreciate the beliefs and practices of the other person’s faith upon which you can agree.
4. If the other person is willing, share with them what the Gospel is about in a clear, honest way, with sensitivity, but also without apology or ‘watering’ down the Gospel.
5. Be honest about the differences between their faith and your faith.
6. Continue to maintain and deepen a respect and love for the other person and be open to understanding each other’s faith.
7. Work cooperatively on joint ventures as can be done without injuring the authenticity of other faiths. Sensitively acknowledge that there may also be occasions when either party may not be able to work cooperatively due to their desire to maintain their confessional integrity.
8. Encourage others to openly communicate with people of other faiths in a constructive and sensitive manner.
9. There are always things we can learn from others (and from the faith of others). We could even say that God gives us others as gifts. Every person carries in them the *imago Dei* (the image of God), no matter how tarnished. Dietrich Bonhoeffer also reminds us that Christ is the mediator in all human relationships. We can do well to also ask the question that John Stackhouse suggests that we always ask of the other person: “What have you found that is life-giving and leads to flourishing? Because I would like to know about it!”

## A parable

Imagine that God was going to put on the best and most extravagant musical event the world has ever seen which would include the following line up, all happening on different stages at the one time. On one stage would be the Beatles, on another The Rolling Stones, on another the New York Philharmonic orchestra, on another an Indian ensemble playing a raga, on another an African band, on another an angelic choir.

God wanted everyone to come and hear this fantastic concert so he was offering free tickets to it. He sent out his promoters and they advertised the show and invited everybody in the world to come to this amazing show in this gigantic auditorium. But there were some people who said that they were busy with other matters that were more important to them, others who thought it might just be a trick, and others who were unhappy that their favourite band was not on one of the stages and so they did not want to come. Others were cheesed off that their band, in which they personally played, was not invited to be part of the line-up.

The vast majority of people accepted the free tickets and were really looking forward to the show even though it might not have exactly suited them. They felt privileged to be invited. But some people who really wanted to go were also very sad that some of their friends had decided not to go, so they tried to persuade their friends that it would be just the best show and that it would be good to share the experience together. But they were unable to convince them. They hoped that they would change their minds at the last moment before the show began and before the concert doors were closed.

They pointed to all the musicians arriving with their roadies for the gig, and outside the venue they could even hear some of the various groups practicing for the big event. They were really concerned that their friends would miss out on this once in a life-time opportunity. They were even tempted to miss the concert and stay outside with their friends because they valued their company more than the concert. What should they do? Could they perhaps ask God to organize this at a later time or get better advertising boards or perhaps change the line up? Could perhaps God add some more sweeteners to the free offer like free meals and drinks during the event? God threw in these and a great banquet as well … all free.

So what are our options when we want our friends to come to the concert but they are not sure or do not want to come? I guess we could ask God to cancel the whole show because it is creating divisions. Or else we can continue to invite them and assure them that it is really going to be an amazing show. There had been some bad publicity about it by some people such as those who were putting restrictions on who can and who cannot get the free tickets, saying that you have to have some form of payment (personal or monetary) in addition to the free ticket. Others were scalping the tickets and trying to convince people that the concert is free, provided they pay something.

How does this parable end up? Nobody knows because no person is God and none of us know the future, and so we do not know who will eventually go to the concert. The concert is in God’s hands, and so are we, as well as our friends and all people. But God tells us it will be the best concert and that we are all invited. We just have the privilege to keep inviting everyone.
